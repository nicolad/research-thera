As a result, research on this subject is urgently needed to develop appropriate countermeasures. This study builds on Person-Environment fit theory to investigate social connections at work and mental health during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. It analyses employees\u2019 needs for social connections and how social connections affect different mental health measures. Survey data were collected in May 2020 in an online survey of employees across Germany and analysed using response surface analysis. Mental health was measured as positive mental health and mental health disorders. Social connections were measured as social support and social interactions. 507 employees participated in the survey and more than one third reported having less social support and social interaction at work than they desired (p &lt; .001). This was associated with a decrease in mental health. In contrast, having more than the desired amount of social support was associated with a decrease and having more than the desired amount of social interaction with an increase in mental health. This study provides important early evidence on the impact of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in the workplace. With it, we aim to stimulate further research in the field and provide early evidence on potential mental health consequences of social distancing measures \u2013 while also opening avenues to combat them.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1101\/2022.03.04.22270966","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,7]],"date-time":"2022-03-07T20:50:18Z","timestamp":1646686218000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Social connections at work and mental health during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic: Evidence from employees in Germany"],"prefix":"10.64898","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6257-3432","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jonas","family":"Breetzke","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7243-5984","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Eva-Maria","family":"Wild","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"54368","reference":[{"key":"2022030912050606000_2022.03.04.22270966v1.1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/0020764020922269"},{"key":"2022030912050606000_2022.03.04.22270966v1.2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/0020764020927047"},{"key":"2022030912050606000_2022.03.04.22270966v1.3","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1080\/09638237.2021.1875413"},{"key":"2022030912050606000_2022.03.04.22270966v1.4","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/0020764020938807"},{"key":"2022030912050606000_2022.03.04.22270966v1.5","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/S0140-6736(20)30460-8"},{"key":"2022030912050606000_2022.03.04.22270966v1.6","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1111\/jgs.16527"},{"key":"2022030912050606000_2022.03.04.22270966v1.7","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1080\/09585192.2012.665070"},{"key":"2022030912050606000_2022.03.04.22270966v1.8","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/s00127-016-1178-7"},{"key":"2022030912050606000_2022.03.04.22270966v1.9","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0258344"},{"key":"2022030912050606000_2022.03.04.22270966v1.10","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0241895"},{"key":"2022030912050606000_2022.03.04.22270966v1.11","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.3390\/ijerph17072381"},{"key":"2022030912050606000_2022.03.04.22270966v1.12","unstructured":"Harnois G , Gabriel P.
