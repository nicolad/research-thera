While an unprecedented social safety net policy response successfully offset earnings losses among lower-wage workers, the risk of continued and persistent unemployment remains higher among the working class. The key lesson from the Great Recession is that strong economic growth and a hot labor market do more to improve the economic well-being of the working class and historically disadvantaged groups than a slow recovery that relies on safety net policies to help replace lost earnings. Thus, the best way to prevent a \u201ck-shaped\u201d recovery is to ensure that safety net policies do not interfere with a return to the strong pre-pandemic economy once the health risk subsides and that progrowth policies that incentivize business investment and hiring are maintained.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177\/00027162211031772","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,23]],"date-time":"2021-08-23T12:05:58Z","timestamp":1629720358000},"page":"314-330","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/sage-journals-update-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Policies to Help the Working Class in the Aftermath of COVID-19: Lessons from the Great Recession"],"prefix":"10.1177","volume":"695","author":[{"given":"Richard V.","family":"Burkhauser","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Kevin","family":"Corinth","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Douglas","family":"Holtz-Eakin","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"179","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,8,23]]},"reference":[{"key":"e_1_3_3_2_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/00027162211028822"},{"key":"e_1_3_3_3_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/00027162211025476"},{"key":"e_1_3_3_4_1","unstructured":"Altonji Joseph Contractor Zara Finamor Lucas Haygood Ryan Lindenlaub Ilse Meghir Costas O\u2019Dea Cormac Scott Dana Wang Liana Washington Ebonya. 2020.

Though still too early to tell for sure, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to accentuate previous fault lines in the worlds of residential real estate and introduce new ones. I pay particular attention to observations and predictions relevant to what the book has focused on\u2014such as how real estate workshop companies refigured what they do when they can no longer hold public meetings; how if at all the three HGTV programs shifted their coverage; and how the pandemic influenced where the enterprises that profited from people lived, travelled to, and worked. Among the topics are the intensification of the home as haven and workplace; the threats working and shopping at home posed to commercial real estate; how people reconfigured where they lived or decided to live elsewhere; and how the pandemic exacerbated gendered, racial, and class divisions.
