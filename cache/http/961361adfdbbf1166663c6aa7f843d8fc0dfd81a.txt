Latin America is one of the regions that has been most strongly affected. The main aim of this paper is to assess the dynamics of family income inequality and its components since the onset of the pandemic in six Latin American countries -Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Peru and Uruguay-. The unequalizing impact of the worsening of the labour market during the contraction phase was mainly associated with the significant loss of informal, low-paid, jobs. This effect was offset, at least partially, by the equalizing role of cash transfers policies put in place in the outbreak of the pandemic. An opposite impact of these income sources appears during the recovery phase, as most countries gradually reduced or stopped those transfers as employment and, therefore, labour incomes partially recovered. Nearly two years into the COVID-19 pandemic inequality is higher than 2019 in almost all countries studied exacerbating existing high-income gaps in one of the world's most unequal regions.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-2139823\/v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,18]],"date-time":"2022-10-18T16:57:19Z","timestamp":1666112239000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The distribute impact of labour market and cash transfer policies during the COVID-19 pandemic in Latin America"],"prefix":"10.21203","author":[{"given":"Luis","family":"Beccaria","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"National University of General Sarmiento"}]},{"given":"Roxana","family":"Maurizio","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"International Labour Organization"}]},{"given":"SIlvana","family":"Martinez","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Instituto Interdisciplinario de Econom\u00eda Pol\u00edtica, UBA"}]}],"member":"8761","reference":[{"key":"ref1","author":"Acevedo I","year":"2022","unstructured":"Acevedo, I., Castellani, F., Cota, M., Lotti, G., Sz\u00e9kely, M.: Higher Inequality in Latin America: A Collateral Effect of the Pandemic.
