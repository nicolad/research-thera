Leveraging data from the 2023 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), covering 71 education systems and spanning two decades, we quantify the global impact of pandemic-related disruptions on student achievement in mathematics and science. Using mixed-effects models, we estimate deviations from pre-pandemic trends, adjusting for demographic and school-level factors. We find that average achievement declined by 0.11 standard deviations globally, with longer school closures associated with larger losses. Disadvantaged groups\u2014including low performers, girls, and linguistic minorities\u2014experienced greater setbacks, reaching up to 0.23 standard deviations. These findings reveal a persistent global learning crisis and highlight the urgent need for targeted policy responses to address educational inequalities exacerbated by the pandemic.<\/p>","DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-6566438\/v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,6,3]],"date-time":"2025-06-03T07:21:13Z","timestamp":1748935273000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The Learning Crisis: Three Years after COVID-19"],"prefix":"10.21203","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4939-3568","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Harry","family":"Patrinos","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Arkansas"}]},{"given":"Tomasz","family":"Gajderowicz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Warsaw"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2512-3133","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Maciej","family":"Jakubowski","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Warsaw"}]},{"given":"Alec","family":"Kennedy","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement"}]},{"given":"Christian","family":"Kjeldsen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Aarhus University"}]},{"given":"Rolf","family":"Strietholt","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement"}]}],"member":"297","link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchsquare.com\/article\/rs-6566438\/v1","content-type":"text\/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchsquare.com\/article\/rs-6566438\/v1.html","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2025,6,3]],"date-time":"2025-06-03T07:21:13Z","timestamp":1748935273000},"score":40.462566,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchsquare.com\/article\/rs-6566438\/v1"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2025,6,3]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.21203\/rs.3.rs-6566438\/v1","published":{"date-parts":[[2025,6,3]]},"subtype":"preprint"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2025,2,5]],"date-time":"2025-02-05T22:40:22Z","timestamp":1738795222986,"version":"3.37.0"},"posted":{"date-parts":[[2025]]},"group-title":"SSRN","reference-count":52,"publisher":"Elsevier BV","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"DOI":"10.2139\/ssrn.5059328","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,2,5]],"date-time":"2025-02-05T21:56:59Z","timestamp":1738792619000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The Learning Crisis: Three Years After COVID-19"],"prefix":"10.2139","author":[{"given":"Tomasz","family":"Gajderowicz","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Maciej","family":"Jakubowski","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Alec","family":"Kennedy","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Christian Christrup","family":"Kjeldsen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Harry Anthony","family":"Patrinos","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Rolf","family":"Strietholt","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"78","reference":[{"issue":"1","key":"ref1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"266","DOI":"10.1162\/rest_a_01170","article-title":"School closures during the 1918 flu pandemic","volume":"106","author":"P Ager","year":"2024","journal-title":"Review of Economics and Statistics"},{"issue":"4","key":"ref2","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"672","DOI":"10.1086\/507154","article-title":"Is the 1918 influenza pandemic over?
