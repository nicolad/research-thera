Headline indicators show an improvement in most regions, with a slight deterioration for 2024 and considerable downside risk. Employment is growing in all regions, although often driven by growth in the working\u2010age population. Employment\u2010to\u2010population ratios are also approaching pre\u2010pandemic (2019) levels in most regions. Unemployment rates are also recovering to pre\u2010pandemic levels, with similar subregional exceptions, including non\u2010GCC Arab States and East Asia, for which ratios remain above 2019 levels. Considerable heterogeneity remains across subregions and different labour market dimensions. Weaker job growth is expected in 2024 owing to various geopolitical tensions and tighter global monetary conditions.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1002\/wow3.204","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,2,29]],"date-time":"2024-02-29T13:55:18Z","timestamp":1709214918000},"page":"37-60","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":28,"title":["Employment and social trends by region"],"prefix":"10.1002","volume":"2024","author":[{"given":"Richard","family":"Horne","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"ILO"}]}],"member":"311","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024,2,29]]},"container-title":["World Employment and Social Outlook"],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/pdf\/10.1002\/wow3.204","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2024,2,29]],"date-time":"2024-02-29T13:55:22Z","timestamp":1709214922000},"score":41.196068,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/wow3.204"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2024,2]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"1","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2024,2]]}},"alternative-id":["10.1002\/wow3.204"],"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/wow3.204","archive":["Portico"],"ISSN":["2059-3031","2059-3031"],"issn-type":[{"value":"2059-3031","type":"print"},{"value":"2059-3031","type":"electronic"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2024,2]]},"assertion":[{"value":"2024-02-29","order":2,"name":"published","label":"Published","group":{"name":"publication_history","label":"Publication History"}}]},{"institution":[{"id":[{"id":"https:\/\/ror.org\/03tebpn36","id-type":"ROR","asserted-by":"publisher"},{"id":"https:\/\/www.wikidata.org\/entity\/Q54129","id-type":"wikidata","asserted-by":"publisher"}],"name":"International Labour Organization","department":["RESEARCH"]}],"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2026,2,4]],"date-time":"2026-02-04T18:24:53Z","timestamp":1770229493715,"version":"3.49.0"},"publisher-location":"Geneva","reference-count":0,"publisher":"ILO","isbn-type":[{"value":"9789220400418","type":"electronic"}],"license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2024,1,1]],"date-time":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1704067200000},"content-version":"unspecified","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0\/"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"DOI":"10.54394\/hqae1085","type":"report","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,1,10]],"date-time":"2024-01-10T09:04:31Z","timestamp":1704877471000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":28,"title":["World employment and social outlook"],"prefix":"10.54394","author":[{"name":"ILO","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"name":"International Labour Organization","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"32269","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024]]},"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2025,7,30]],"date-time":"2025-07-30T23:00:23Z","timestamp":1753916423000},"score":39.433006,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/researchrepository.ilo.org\/esploro\/outputs\/report\/995343385502676"}},"subtitle":["Trends 2024"],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2024]]},"ISBN":["9789220400418"],"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.54394\/hqae1085","relation":{"has-translation":[{"id-type":"doi","id":"10.54394\/BTBG2047","asserted-by":"subject"},{"id-type":"doi","id":"10.54394\/EIIX3179","asserted-by":"subject"}]},"published":{"date-parts":[[2024]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2025,5,30]],"date-time":"2025-05-30T23:40:10Z","timestamp":1748648410544,"version":"3.41.0"},"publisher-location":"Geneva","reference-count":0,"publisher":"ILO","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2025,1,1]],"date-time":"2025-01-01T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1735689600000},"content-version":"unspecified","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0\/"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"DOI":"10.54394\/xmeg0270","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,5,30]],"date-time":"2025-05-30T23:00:27Z","timestamp":1748646027000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["World employment and social outlook"],"prefix":"10.54394","author":[{"name":"International Labour Organization.
