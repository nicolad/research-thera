Using a novel firm level survey linked with administrative data on the universe of workers within those firms, I study the role of E-learning in firms\u2019 training activities during the crisis. I find that the COVID-19 pandemic substantially decreased firm-sponsored training by up to 11 percentage points. However, firms\u2019 ability to use E-learning nullifies this negative effect. Furthermore, the differential capabilities of firms to apply E-learning might exacerbate already prevalent inequalities in training opportunities.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1186\/s12651-024-00382-x","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,11,10]],"date-time":"2024-11-10T11:45:19Z","timestamp":1731239119000},"update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The COVID-19 pandemic and firms\u2019 E-learning use: implications for inequality in training opportunities"],"prefix":"10.1186","volume":"58","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3829-8223","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Christoph","family":"M\u00fcller","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024,11,10]]},"reference":[{"key":"382_CR1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"104245","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jpubeco.2020.104245","volume":"189","author":"A Adams-Prassl","year":"2020","unstructured":"Adams-Prassl, A., Boneva, T., Golin, M., Rauh, C.: Inequality in the impact of the coronavirus shock: evidence from real time surveys.
