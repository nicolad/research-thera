Face-to-face interactions, in particular, catalyze the social connection necessary for psychological well-being. What happens, then, when a global pandemic disrupts normal patterns of social engagement? Starting in March 2020, the world uploaded much of its face-to-face interactions online, transitioning en masse to remote work, learning, and socializing. These circumstances provide a natural experiment for studying how virtual interactions\u2014socialization mediated by digital devices\u2014facilitate psychosocial well-being relative to face-to-face interactions. We conducted two studies measuring how seven types of virtual and face-to-face interactions impacted people\u2019s feelings of positive affect and social connection. Study 1 longitudinally tracked virtual interactions and well-being (n = 999) in three waves from May 2020 to May 2021. Study 2 measured participants\u2019 (n = 249) virtual interactions and well-being three times daily for two weeks. Both studies suggest that voice calling, group calling, and online messaging increased feelings of both social connection and positive affect in the short- and long-term.

This study also suggests that perceived social isolation played a significant part in general social well-being.  As the perception of fear decreased over time, we anticipate that other factors that contribute to anxiety and general well-being will also improve as societies adapt to the novel virus, restrictions ease, and vaccines improve in efficacy.<\/p>\n                <\/sec>","DOI":"10.2196\/preprints.44889","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,7]],"date-time":"2022-12-07T21:46:36Z","timestamp":1670449596000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Indian diaspora perspectives on social well-being during COVID-19 pandemic (Preprint)"],"prefix":"10.2196","author":[{"given":"Saivya","family":"Shrivastav","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Maneesh","family":"Shrivastav","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"1010","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,7]],"date-time":"2022-12-07T21:46:36Z","timestamp":1670449596000},"score":44.37553,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http:\/\/preprints.jmir.org\/preprint\/44889"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,7]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.2196\/preprints.44889","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,7]]},"subtype":"preprint"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,20]],"date-time":"2023-03-20T01:11:27Z","timestamp":1679274687219},"posted":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,17]]},"group-title":"SOCIAL SCIENCES","reference-count":0,"publisher":"MDPI AG","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,17]],"date-time":"2023-03-17T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1679011200000},"content-version":"unspecified","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"accepted":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,17]]},"abstract":"<jats:p>The global Covid-19 crisis has seen the push for many education institutions substituting traditional classroom learning to online platforms. This change in the learning experience has been expected to cause major and likely unequal interruption not only in students\u2019 learning, but their well-being overall. Given this, the present study aims to investigate how online or open distance learning, implemented during times of a health crisis, impacted the mental well-being of UiTM students. The study was conducted via an online survey and an online group discussion during the last week of online classes between 29th June to 1st July 2020. Following research on negative emotional states, the short form of the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS-21) was included in the survey. Results indicate that students experienced varying levels of negative emotions, specifically feeling anxious over situations that might cause panic, feeling emotionally sensitive as well as feeling less motivated to do things. Discussions include how the government of Malaysia needs to ensure for students to be equipped with the right amenities that will offer a smoother ODL experience and that educational institutions provide their stakeholders with clear information so that students can make a more informed choice about their education.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.20944\/preprints202303.0317.v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,20]],"date-time":"2023-03-20T00:38:56Z","timestamp":1679272736000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["ODL and Mental Well-Being: An Explorative Study of UiTM Students during the COVID-19 Pandemic"],"prefix":"10.20944","author":[{"given":"Siti Aeisha","family":"Joharry","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"1968","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,20]],"date-time":"2023-03-20T00:39:07Z","timestamp":1679272747000},"score":42.39417,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.preprints.org\/manuscript\/202303.0317\/v1"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,17]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.20944\/preprints202303.0317.v1","published":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,17]]},"subtype":"preprint"}],"items-per-page":5,"query":{"start-index":0,"search-terms":null}}}
