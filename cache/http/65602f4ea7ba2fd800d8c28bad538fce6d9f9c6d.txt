We estimate a year\u2010end increase of 17\u201318 percentage points in Peru and India (Andhra Pradesh and Telangana), and 9.5 percentage points in Vietnam. A mediation approach is used to establish whether\u2014and to what extent\u2014commonly suggested mechanisms are responsible for the change in labour market composition during 2020. We find that new or increased caring responsibilities explain between 16.5% and 21.1% of the widening employment gap. However, we find little evidence that a slower female recovery can be explained by differences in the probability of contact\u2010intensive employment or the unequal distribution of caring responsibilities before the pandemic. These results have implications for policy responses in the event of similar outbreaks in the future.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1111\/rode.13236","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,5,14]],"date-time":"2025-05-14T01:54:45Z","timestamp":1747187685000},"page":"2693-2705","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Unpacking the <scp>COVID<\/scp>\u201019 Gender Employment Gap Among Young People in the Global South"],"prefix":"10.1111","volume":"29","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0393-0724","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Douglas","family":"Scott","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Economics and Related Studies University of York  York UK"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2721-2607","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Richard","family":"Freund","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Economics University of Cape Town  Cape Town South Africa"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5764-4654","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Marta","family":"Favara","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Oxford Department of International Development University of Oxford  Oxford UK"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8578-1744","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Catherine","family":"Porter","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Lancaster University Management School Lancaster University  Lancaster UK"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7109-8613","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Alan","family":"S\u00e1nchez","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Oxford Department of International Development University of Oxford  Oxford UK"},{"name":"Grupo de An\u00e1lisis Para el Desarrollo  Lima Peru"}]}],"member":"311","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2025,5,13]]},"reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_13_2_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jpubeco.2020.104245"},{"key":"e_1_2_13_3_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1257\/jep.35.3.3"},{"key":"e_1_2_13_4_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1086\/718660"},{"key":"e_1_2_13_5_1","first-page":"62","article-title":"The Impact of COVID\u201019 on Gender Equality","volume":"4","author":"Alon T.","year":"2020","journal-title":"Covid Economics"},{"key":"e_1_2_13_6_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.3386\/w27660"},{"key":"e_1_2_13_7_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1162\/rest_a_01008"},{"key":"e_1_2_13_8_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1093\/ije\/dys082"},{"key":"e_1_2_13_9_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/s11150\u2010023\u201009648\u20108"},{"volume-title":"City of Dreams No More: The Impact of COVID\u201019 on Urban Workers in India","year":"2020","author":"Bhalotia S.","key":"e_1_2_13_10_1"},{"key":"e_1_2_13_11_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.labeco.2022.102308"},{"key":"e_1_2_13_12_1","first-page":"1","volume-title":"Young Lives Technical Note","author":"Briones K.","year":"2017"},{"key":"e_1_2_13_13_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/00197939221076856"},{"key":"e_1_2_13_14_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/S0891\u20105520(03)00095\u20103"},{"key":"e_1_2_13_15_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.2478\/izajole\u20102022\u20100003"},{"key":"e_1_2_13_16_1","unstructured":"Escobal J. andE.Flores.2008.An Assessment of the Young Lives Sampling Approach in Peru.
