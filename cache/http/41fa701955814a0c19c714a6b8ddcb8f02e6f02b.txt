By conducting mediation analyses with a sequential g-estimator on OECD data, this paper finds evidence that suggests otherwise. Specifically, both leftist and rightist parties in OECD countries are found to take on more conservative policy stances through the median voter mechanism when income inequality increases. On the other hand, the results of the analyses show that through other causal pathways, an increase in inequality induces both parties to turn more progressive.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.29152\/koiks.2022.53.3.523","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,14]],"date-time":"2022-09-14T05:03:51Z","timestamp":1663131831000},"page":"523-545","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Effect of Income Inequality on Party Position in OECD Countries"],"prefix":"10.29152","volume":"53","author":[{"name":"Institute of Korean Studies","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Aram","family":"Kim","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"11698","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,31]]},"container-title":["Korea Observer - Institute of Korean Studies"],"original-title":["Effect of Income Inequality on Party Position in OECD Countries"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,14]],"date-time":"2022-09-14T05:03:59Z","timestamp":1663131839000},"score":36.098618,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/scholar.kyobobook.co.kr\/article\/detail\/4010036847311"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,31]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"3","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,31]]},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,31]]}},"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.29152\/koiks.2022.53.3.523","ISSN":["0023-3919"],"issn-type":[{"type":"print","value":"0023-3919"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,31]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2025,1,24]],"date-time":"2025-01-24T05:27:48Z","timestamp":1737696468065,"version":"3.33.0"},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Korea International Trade Research Institute","issue":"6","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["Korea Int Trade Res Inst"],"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2024,12,31]]},"abstract":"<jats:p\/>","DOI":"10.16980\/jitc.20.6.202412.1","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,1,24]],"date-time":"2025-01-24T02:47:58Z","timestamp":1737686878000},"page":"1-16","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The Relationship between Income Inequality and CO2 Emissions: Empirical Evidence from OECD and Non-OECD Countries"],"prefix":"10.16980","volume":"20","author":[{"name":"The Korea International Trade Research Institute","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hyun-Soo","family":"Kang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"6650","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024,12,31]]},"container-title":["Korea International Trade Research Institute"],"original-title":["The Relationship between Income Inequality and CO2 Emissions: Empirical Evidence from OECD and Non-OECD Countries"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2025,1,24]],"date-time":"2025-01-24T02:48:03Z","timestamp":1737686883000},"score":35.714363,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/scholar.kyobobook.co.kr\/article\/detail\/4010070349257"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2024,12,31]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"6","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024,12,31]]},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2024,12,31]]}},"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.16980\/jitc.20.6.202412.1","published":{"date-parts":[[2024,12,31]]}}],"items-per-page":5,"query":{"start-index":0,"search-terms":null}}}
