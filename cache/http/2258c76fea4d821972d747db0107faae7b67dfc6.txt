Our findings highlight the importance of care provisions for gender equity, with gaps larger among parents than people without children, and most pronounced when care and employment were more difficult to reconcile. When employment barriers eased, so did the gender\u2013employment gap. The pandemic could not undo longer-standing cultural and structural shifts motivating contemporary mothers\u2019 employment.
