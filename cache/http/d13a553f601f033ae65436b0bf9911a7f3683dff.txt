We implement a discrete choice experiment survey in three major U.S. States\u2014California, Georgia, and Illinois\u2014to empirically quantify individuals\u2019 willingness to stay (WTS) home, measured as the number of weeks of a potential new SAH order, to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 disease and explore factors leading to their heterogeneous WTS. Our results demonstrate broad support for statewide mask mandates. In addition, the estimate of WTS to lower new positive cases is quite large, approximately five and half weeks, even though staying home lowers utility. We also find that individuals recognize the trade-offs between case reduction and economic slowdown stemming from SAH orders when they decide to stay home or not. Finally, pandemic related factors such as age, ability to work from home, and unemployment status are the main drivers of the heterogeneity in individuals\u2019 WTS.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0253910","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,1]],"date-time":"2021-07-01T18:13:24Z","timestamp":1625163204000},"page":"e0253910","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.corrections_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":15,"title":["Stay-at-home orders and the willingness to stay home during the COVID-19 pandemic: A stated-preference discrete choice experiment"],"prefix":"10.1371","volume":"16","author":[{"given":"Liqing","family":"Li","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1908-186X","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Dede","family":"Long","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mani","family":"Rouhi Rad","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Matthew R.","family":"Sloggy","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"340","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,1]]},"reference":[{"key":"pone.0253910.ref001","article-title":"What will be the economic impact of covid-19 in the us? rough estimates of disease scenarios","author":"A Atkeson","year":"2020","journal-title":"National Bureau of Economic Research"},{"key":"pone.0253910.ref002","article-title":"How much does covid-19 increase with mobility? evidence from new york and four other us cities","author":"EL Glaeser","year":"2020","journal-title":"National Bureau of Economic Research"},{"issue":"4","key":"pone.0253910.ref003","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"525","DOI":"10.1007\/s10640-020-00466-5","article-title":"Cross-Country Comparisons of Covid-19: Policy, Politics and the Price of Life","volume":"76","author":"B Balmford","year":"2020","journal-title":"Environmental and Resource Economics"},{"key":"pone.0253910.ref004","first-page":"1","article-title":"The benefits and costs of using social distancing to flatten the curve for COVID-19","author":"L Thunstr\u00f6m","year":"2020","journal-title":"Journal of Benefit-Cost Analysis"},{"key":"pone.0253910.ref005","article-title":"Unemployment Disrupts Sleep","author":"DG Blanchflower","year":"2020","journal-title":"National Bureau of Economic Research"},{"journal-title":"Forced social isolation and mental health: A study on 1006 Italians under COVID-19 quarantine","year":"2020","author":"L Pancani","key":"pone.0253910.ref006"},{"key":"pone.0253910.ref007","article-title":"Psychological Distress during the COVID-19 pandemic in France: a national assessment of at-risk populations","author":"B Chaix","year":"2020","journal-title":"medRxiv"},{"key":"pone.0253910.ref008","article-title":"A multi-risk SIR model with optimally targeted lockdown","author":"D Acemoglu","year":"2020","journal-title":"National Bureau of Economic Research"},{"issue":"4","key":"pone.0253910.ref009","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"705","DOI":"10.1007\/s10640-020-00440-1","article-title":"Effects of Physical Distancing to Control COVID-19 on Public Health, the Economy, and the Environment","volume":"76","author":"SC Newbold","year":"2020","journal-title":"Environmental and Resource Economics"},{"key":"pone.0253910.ref010","article-title":"Implications of heterogeneous SIR models for analyses of COVID-19","author":"G Ellison","year":"2020","journal-title":"National Bureau of Economic Research"},{"key":"pone.0253910.ref011","article-title":"Internal and external effects of social distancing in a pandemic","author":"M Farboodi","year":"2020","journal-title":"National Bureau of Economic Research"},{"key":"pone.0253910.ref012","article-title":"Reopening Scenarios","author":"D Baqaee","year":"2020","journal-title":"National Bureau of Economic Research"},{"key":"pone.0253910.ref013","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Greenstone M, Nigam V.
