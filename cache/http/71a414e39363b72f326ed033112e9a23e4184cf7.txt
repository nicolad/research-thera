We throw light on the underlying context\u2014the demand for and supply of truck drivers\u2014by investigating why states within the contiguous United States showed vastly different rates of recovery of state\u2010level truck transportation payrolls for May 2020\u2013December 2021 following the negative employment shock brought about by COVID\u201019 lockdowns in April 2020. We focus on heterogeneity in the industries that create demand for trucking services: state\u2010level natural resource extraction, warehousing, and container port activity. We create a state\u2010level archival data set of truck transportation establishment payrolls from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, which we combine with other archival sources. We test our hypotheses via discontinuous growth curve models estimated using the mixed effects modeling framework. We find states that saw greater declines in natural resource extraction activity had much slower growth in trucking payrolls for May 2020\u2013December 2021, whereas states that saw more warehousing activity growth or were home to large container ports saw faster growth in trucking payrolls. Our work extends theories regarding labor market dynamics in truck transportation and factor market rivalry, in addition to having important implications for managers and policy makers.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1002\/tjo3.12038","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,12,20]],"date-time":"2024-12-20T08:48:20Z","timestamp":1734684500000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Shedding light on truck driver supply and demand: Heterogeneous state\u2010level recovery of trucking employment following the <scp>COVID<\/scp>\u201019 employment shock"],"prefix":"10.1002","volume":"64","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2626-0049","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jonathan","family":"Phares","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Supply Chain Management, Ivy College of Business Iowa State University  Ames Iowa USA"}]},{"given":"Jason W.","family":"Miller","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Supply Chain Management, Eli Broad College of Business Michigan State University  East Lansing Michigan USA"}]},{"given":"Stephen V.","family":"Burks","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Division of Social Science University of Minnesota, Morris  Morris Minnesota USA"}]}],"member":"311","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024,12,20]]},"reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_8_2_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1086\/705716"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_3_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1111\/jofi.12495"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_4_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.eneco.2016.12.012"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_5_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1093\/restud\/rdx042"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_6_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/0041-1647(77)90061-2"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_7_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/1098214010371972"},{"volume-title":"The US Truck Driver Shortage: Analysis and Forecasts","year":"2005","author":"ATA","key":"e_1_2_8_8_1"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_9_1","unstructured":"ATA.2021a.\u201cDriver Shortage Update 2021.\u201dhttps:\/\/www.trucking.org\/sites\/default\/files\/2021-10\/ATA%20Driver%20Shortage%20Report%202021%20Executive%20Summary.FINAL_.pdf"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_10_1","unstructured":"ATA.2021b.\u201cIndustry Short 80 000 Drivers Today May Be Short 160 000 by 2030.\u201dhttps:\/\/www.trucking.org\/news-insights\/ata-chief-economist-pegs-driver-shortage-historic-high"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_11_1","unstructured":"ATA.2022.\u201cDriver Shortage Update 2022.\u201dhttps:\/\/www.ttnews.com\/articles\/driver-shortage-decreases-slightly-78000-ata-says"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_12_1","unstructured":"BEA.2023a.\u201cReal Imports of Goods: Consumer Goods Except Food and Automotive: Durable Goods (B697RX1Q020SBEA).\u201dhttps:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/B697RX1Q020SBEA"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_13_1","unstructured":"BEA.2023b.\u201cReal Personal Consumption Expenditures: Durable Goods (Chain\u2010Type Quantity Index) (DDURRA3M086SBEA).\u201dhttps:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/DDURRA3M086SBEA"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_14_1","first-page":"20","article-title":"Occupational Loyalties among Truck Drivers","volume":"29","author":"Beilock R.","year":"1990","journal-title":"Transportation Journal"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_15_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.5325\/transportationj.54.1.0089"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_16_1","unstructured":"Bhattarai A.2021.\u201cWarehouse Jobs\u2014Recently Thought of as Jobs of the Future\u2014Are Suddenly Jobs Few Workers Want.\u201dhttps:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/business\/2021\/10\/11\/warehouse\u2010jobs\u2010holidays\u2010seasonal\u2010hiring\/"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_17_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/1094428116633502"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_18_1","unstructured":"BLS.2022.\u201cMay 2021 National Industry\u2010Specific Occupational Employment and Wage Estimates.\u201dhttps:\/\/www.bls.gov\/oes\/current\/naics4_484000.htm"},{"volume-title":"All Employees, Warehousing and Storage (CES4349300001)","year":"2023","author":"BLS","key":"e_1_2_8_19_1"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_20_1","unstructured":"BLS.2023b.\u201cAll Employees Truck Transportation (CES4348400001).\u201dhttps:\/\/fred.stlouisfed.org\/series\/CES4348400001"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_21_1","unstructured":"BLS.2023c.\u201cQuarterly Census of Employment and Wages: Concepts.\u201dhttps:\/\/www.bls.gov\/opub\/hom\/cew\/concepts.htm"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_22_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jtrangeo.2008.03.001"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_23_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1080\/00031305.1994.10476059"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_24_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1073\/pnas.0812360106"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_25_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.21916\/mlr.2019.5"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_26_1","unstructured":"Burks S.
