Moreover, based on ecological perspectives on the role of family context, we consider partnership status and parental status as predictors of changes in these variables over time. Using a longitudinal research design, we model co-occurring trajectories of changes in family demands and satisfaction with family life between early April 2020 and early September 2020 using unconditional and conditional multivariate latent growth curve modeling. Results suggest that, on average, both family demands and satisfaction with family life increased across this time period and that having minor children \u2264 17 years of age was associated with decreases in satisfaction with family life across time. Moreover, an exploratory analysis suggests that partnership status may help offset the positive relationship between parental status and family demands. These findings have implications for future research on family life during a crisis and suggest that single parents of young children should be the focus of interventions to reduce family-related stressors and increase levels of family wellbeing during times of crisis.<\/p>","DOI":"10.31234\/osf.io\/8a3gx","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,16]],"date-time":"2021-03-16T17:58:28Z","timestamp":1615917508000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Family Demands and Satisfaction with Family Life During the COVID-19 Pandemic"],"prefix":"10.31234","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0536-9638","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Cort W.","family":"Rudolph","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6336-2947","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Hannes","family":"Zacher","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"15934","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2025,11,17]],"date-time":"2025-11-17T18:52:38Z","timestamp":1763405558000},"score":38.828476,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/osf.io\/8a3gx_v1"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,16]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/8a3gx","relation":{"is-preprint-of":[{"id-type":"doi","id":"10.1037\/cfp0000170","asserted-by":"subject"}]},"published":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,16]]},"subtype":"preprint"},{"institution":[{"name":"Research Square"}],"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,6]],"date-time":"2022-10-06T16:15:05Z","timestamp":1665072905850},"posted":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,6]]},"group-title":"In Review","reference-count":72,"publisher":"Research Square Platform LLC","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,6]],"date-time":"2022-10-06T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1665014400000},"content-version":"unspecified","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0\/"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"accepted":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,7]]},"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n        <jats:p><jats:bold>Background: <\/jats:bold>Literature review has showed that family functioning is positively associated with satisfaction with life.

This study examined the mediating role of hope and resilience in the association between family functioning and life satisfaction of female university students in COVID-19 pandemics.\n<jats:bold>Methods: <\/jats:bold>A cross-sectional online study was done throughout the fifth wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in Iran. A total of 480 female students were recruited from Lorestan University. Data was collected by the State Hope Scale (SHS), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), Family APGAR Index, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC). Data analysis were based on structural equation modeling.\n<jats:bold>Results: <\/jats:bold>Family functioning exerted a significant direct effect on hope, on resilience and on life satisfaction. Also, according to the findings, hope and resilience pose a significant mediating effect in the association between family functioning and life satisfaction.\n<jats:bold>Conclusion: <\/jats:bold>This study provides a better perspective regarding the protective role of hope, family functioning, and resilience on life satisfaction among female university students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Training of such skills is needed to increase life satisfaction in female university students.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-2042581\/v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,6]],"date-time":"2022-10-06T15:53:04Z","timestamp":1665071584000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Does Family Functioning contribute to the Life Satisfaction among Female University Students during COVID-19 Outbreak?"],"prefix":"10.21203","author":[{"given":"Salman","family":"Zarei","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Lorestan University"}]},{"given":"Khadijeh","family":"Fooladvand","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Lorestan University"}]}],"member":"8761","reference":[{"key":"ref1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"589127","DOI":"10.3389\/fpsyt.2020.589127","article-title":"Loneliness and Social Distancing During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Risk Factors and Associations With Psychopathology","volume":"11","author":"Hoffart A","year":"2020","unstructured":"Hoffart A, Johnson SU, Ebrahimi OV.

However, further investigations are needed for internal mechanisms of this relationship. On the other hand, the COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to decrease life satisfaction. We examined the protective impacts of family functioning, hope and resilience on life satisfaction of university students in COVID-19 pandemics. Methods This cross-sectional online survey was conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, between July and December 2021, in Iran. A total of 480 students were recruited from Lorestan University. The State Hope Scale (SHS), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), Family APGAR Index, and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) collected data. Data were analyzed by pearson\u2019 correlation analysis and structural equation modeling. Results Family functioning showed a statistically significant direct effect on hope (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.41, P\u2009&lt;\u2009.001), on resilience (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.39, P\u2009&lt;\u2009.001) and on life satisfaction (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.27, P\u2009&lt;\u20090.01). Also, according to the bootstrapping findings, the mediating effect of hope (indirect effect\u2009=\u2009.21) and resilience (indirect effect\u2009=\u2009.18) in the association between family functioning and life satisfaction was reliable. Conclusion Family functioning, hope and resilience are three important factors influencing university students\u2019 life satisfaction. Interventions to increase family functioning and hope and resilience are needed to elevate life satisfaction for university students.<\/p>","DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-2022482\/v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,6]],"date-time":"2022-09-06T18:42:47Z","timestamp":1662489767000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Does Family Functioning contribute to the Satisfaction with Life among Iranian University Students during COVID-19 Outbreak?"],"prefix":"10.21203","author":[{"given":"Salman","family":"Zarei","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Lorestan University"}]},{"given":"Khadijeh","family":"Fooladvand","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Lorestan University"}]}],"member":"297","reference":[{"key":"ref1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"1.

In addition to the health consequences, the virus has had a significant impact on the society and the economy, including the labor market. The present study aims to assess how traditional working has been transformed into teleworking in Slovakia. The study examines whether Slovakian workers are satisfied with teleworking. The questionnaire survey was conducted in December 2020 during the second wave of the coronavirus in Slovakia. Based on the obtained results, a significant relationship between teleworking satisfaction and salary satisfaction, supervisory support, and job autonomy was found. Based on the obtained results, teleworking introduced due to the coronavirus had a clear positive effect on job satisfaction of the examined Slovakian employees. As a result of teleworking, the relationship between manager and subordinate has improved, and work-life balance has also developed favorably.\nAcknowledgmentsThis study was funded by the Pallas Ath\u00e9n\u00e9 Foundations.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.21511\/ppm.19(3).2021.01","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,8]],"date-time":"2021-07-08T10:48:16Z","timestamp":1625741296000},"page":"1-9","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":33,"title":["Impact of teleworking on job satisfaction among Slovakian employees in the era of COVID-19"],"prefix":"10.21511","volume":"19","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7559-0488","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Peter","family":"Kar\u00e1csony","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Ph.D., Associate Professor, Faculty of Economics and Informatics, Department of Economics, J.

This study evaluates the association between work hours, work\u2013family balance and quality of life (QoL) among teachers during the Chilean health emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic. Teachers from across Chile were contacted via email and social media to answer an online survey. QoL was evaluated via the SF-36 questionnaire, work hours and work\u2013family balance in the pandemic. A total of 336 teachers from across Chile participated in this study. Teachers had a low QoL score, associated with age (p &lt; 0.05). Teachers who were \u226444 showed lower deterioration risks in the Physical Component Summary (OR: 0.54) than the \u226545-year-old age group; simultaneously, the younger group (\u226444 years) had a greater risk (OR: 2.46) of deterioration in the Mental Component Summary than teachers over 45 years. A total of 78.7% of teachers reported having increased their work hours during the COVID-19 pandemic due to teleworking and 86% indicated negative effects on their work\u2013family balance. Pandemic work hours and negative work\u2013family balance increase the risk of reducing the Mental Component Summary (OR: 1.902; OR: 3.996, respectively). Teachers presented low median QoL scores, especially in the Mental Component Summary, suggesting that it would be beneficial to promote a better workload distribution for teachers in emergency contexts, considering the adverse effects of teleworking.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3390\/ijerph18147566","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,16]],"date-time":"2021-07-16T10:52:58Z","timestamp":1626432778000},"page":"7566","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/mdpi_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":84,"title":["Teacher Teleworking during the COVID-19 Pandemic: Association between Work Hours, Work\u2013Family Balance and Quality of Life"],"prefix":"10.3390","volume":"18","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9366-6930","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Pablo A.","family":"Lizana","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Laboratory of Morphological Sciences, Instituto de Biolog\u00eda, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Valpara\u00edso, Valpara\u00edso 2373223, Chile"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3088-0638","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Gustavo","family":"Vega-Fernadez","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Laboratory of Morphological Sciences, Instituto de Biolog\u00eda, Pontificia Universidad Cat\u00f3lica de Valpara\u00edso, Valpara\u00edso 2373223, Chile"}]}],"member":"1968","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,16]]},"reference":[{"key":"ref_1","unstructured":"WHO (2021, February 02).
