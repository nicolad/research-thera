Recent literature has shown that the SARS CoV 2 pandemic has subjected healthcare workers in emergency\/urgent departments and Covid \u221219 departments to work-related stress risk. In a Sicilian hospital, a sample of 50 health workers (25 men\/25 women) was given the \u201cINAIL questionnaire work-related stress risk\u201d structured in 35 items to investigate 7 dimensions of occupational stress (1) Question, (2) Control, (3) Management support, (4) Support from colleagues, (5) Relationships, (6) Role, (7) Change. The results show in 27% of the sample a high level of occupational stress and in 62% an average level of occupational stress with little control and emotional exhaustion, especially in women. In conclusion, to avoid the chronicization of dysfunctional pictures, health institutions must provide staff with psychosocial support services to protect them from the risk of work-related stress. <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177\/10541373221108457","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,21]],"date-time":"2022-06-21T05:16:46Z","timestamp":1655788606000},"page":"608-616","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/sage-journals-update-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Occupational Stress in Healthcare During Covid 19"],"prefix":"10.1177","volume":"31","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6879-4682","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Elvira","family":"Micali","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Messina, Messina, Italy"}]}],"member":"179","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,6,20]]},"reference":[{"key":"bibr1-10541373221108457","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.3390\/ijerph16183243"},{"key":"bibr2-10541373221108457","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jad.2020.11.065"},{"issue":"4","key":"bibr3-10541373221108457","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"190","DOI":"10.1055\/a-1159-5551","volume":"47","author":"Bohlken J.","year":"2020","journal-title":"Psychiatrische Praxis"},{"issue":"5","key":"bibr4-10541373221108457","first-page":"399","volume":"171","author":"Chidiebere Okechukwu E.","year":"2020","journal-title":"La Clinica Terapeutica"},{"key":"bibr5-10541373221108457","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jad.2020.06.022"},{"key":"bibr6-10541373221108457","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0259013"},{"key":"bibr7-10541373221108457","unstructured":"Gazzetta Ufficiale Repubblica italiana (G.U.R.I) n. 101 del 30 aprile 2008 - Suppl.
