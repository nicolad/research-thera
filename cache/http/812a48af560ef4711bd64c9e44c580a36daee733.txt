This paper examines the dynamics of unemployment through a framework of labor market flows incorporating a matching function and identifies a sustained increase in labor market matching efficiency as the primary driver of persistently low post-pandemic unemployment. The framework further suggests that, barring an unlikely reversal of these efficiency gains, the unemployment rate is likely to remain below 3 percent in the medium term. Notably, despite heightened labor market tightness, post-pandemic wage growth in Korea has been modest. The paper develops a variant of the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model, demonstrating that increased labor market matching efficiency helps account for this apparent paradox.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.5089\/9798229008921.001","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,5,2]],"date-time":"2025-05-02T18:05:07Z","timestamp":1746209107000},"page":"1","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Labor Market Matching Efficiency and Koreas Low Post-Pandemic Unemployment"],"prefix":"10.5089","volume":"2025","author":[{"given":"Hua","family":"Chai","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"3029","reference":[{"key":"ref1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.5089\/9798229008921.001.A000","volume":"2025","author":"Hua Chai","year":"2025","unstructured":"Hua Chai, Front Matter, 2025, 2025","journal-title":"Front Matter"},{"key":"ref2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.5089\/9798229008921.001.A001","volume":"2025","author":"Hua Chai","year":"2025","unstructured":"Hua Chai, Labor Market Matching Efficiency and Koreas Low Post-Pandemic Unemployment, 2025, 2025","journal-title":"Labor Market Matching Efficiency and Koreas Low Post-Pandemic Unemployment"}],"container-title":["IMF Working Papers"],"original-title":[],"language":"en","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2025,5,27]],"date-time":"2025-05-27T08:42:10Z","timestamp":1748335330000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/elibrary.imf.org\/view\/journals\/001\/2025\/082\/001.2025.issue-082-en.xml?cid=566483-com-dsp-crossref"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2025,5]]},"references-count":2,"journal-issue":{"issue":"082","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2025,5]]}},"alternative-id":["001A001"],"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5089\/9798229008921.001","relation":{},"ISSN":["1018-5941"],"issn-type":[{"type":"print","value":"1018-5941"}],"subject":[],"published":{"date-parts":[[2025,5]]}}}
