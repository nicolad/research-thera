Using a cross-country dataset in Europe, we document a striking negative relationship between the share of female members in national governments and school closures. We show that a one-standard deviation increase in female members of national governments is associated with a significant reduction in the likelihood of school lockdowns by 24% relative to the average share of school closures. This result is robust to an extensive set of sensitivity checks. We attribute this pattern to a higher awareness of female politicians about the potential costs that school closures imply for families, in particular working mothers with young children.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1093\/epolic\/eiae033","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,26]],"date-time":"2024-06-26T13:53:44Z","timestamp":1719410024000},"page":"765-810","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Women in political power and school closure during COVID times"],"prefix":"10.1093","volume":"39","author":[{"given":"Natalia","family":"Danzer","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin , CESifo, IZA"}]},{"given":"Sebastian","family":"Garcia-Torres","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7994-4060","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Max Friedrich","family":"Steinhardt","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin , IZA, LdA"}]},{"given":"Luca","family":"Stella","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin , CESifo, IZA"},{"name":"Freie Universit\u00e4t Berlin , CESifo, IZA, Catholic University of Milan"}]}],"member":"286","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,27]]},"reference":[{"key":"2024100913161816600_eiae033-B1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"380","DOI":"10.1080\/13545701.2020.1864432","article-title":"Women heads of state and Covid-19 policy responses","volume":"27","author":"Abras","year":"2021","journal-title":"Feminist Economics"},{"key":"2024100913161816600_eiae033-B2","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"104245","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jpubeco.2020.104245","article-title":"Inequality in the impact of the coronavirus shock: evidence from real time surveys","volume":"189","author":"Adams-Prassl","year":"2020","journal-title":"Journal of Public Economics"},{"key":"2024100913161816600_eiae033-B3","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"139","DOI":"10.1093\/epolic\/eiac002","article-title":"The impact of the coronavirus lockdown on mental health: evidence from the United States","volume":"37","author":"Adams-Prassl","year":"2022","journal-title":"Economic Policy"},{"key":"2024100913161816600_eiae033-B4","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"104574","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jpubeco.2021.104574","article-title":"When the great equalizer shuts down: schools, peers, and parents in pandemic times","volume":"206","author":"Agostinelli","year":"2022","journal-title":"Journal of Public Economics"},{"key":"2024100913161816600_eiae033-B5","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"3","DOI":"10.1257\/jep.35.3.3","article-title":"Effects of the COVID-19 recession on the US labor market: occupation, family, and gender","volume":"35","author":"Albanesi","year":"2021","journal-title":"Journal of Economic Perspectives"},{"key":"2024100913161816600_eiae033-B6","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"104003","DOI":"10.1016\/j.euroecorev.2021.104003","article-title":"Schools opening and Covid-19 diffusion: evidence from geolocalized microdata","volume":"143","author":"Amodio","year":"2022","journal-title":"European Economic Review"},{"key":"2024100913161816600_eiae033-B7","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"760","DOI":"10.1093\/oxrep\/graa043","article-title":"Gender diversity in firms","volume":"36","author":"Azmat","year":"2020","journal-title":"Oxford Review of Economic Policy"},{"key":"2024100913161816600_eiae033-B8","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"104315","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jpubeco.2020.104315","article-title":"Can gender quotas in candidate lists empower women?
