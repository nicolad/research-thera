Using longitudinal data collected in 2019 and 2021 as part of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) Survey, fixed-effects models of job satisfaction are estimated. Changes in the share of total weekly work hours usually worked from home are not found to have any significant association with changes in job satisfaction for men. By contrast, a strong significant positive (but nonlinear) association is found for women, and this relationship is concentrated on women with children. These findings suggest the main benefit of working from home for workers arises from the improved ability to combine work and family responsibilities, something that matters more to women given they continue to shoulder most of the responsibility for house and care work. <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177\/00197939241301704","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,12,7]],"date-time":"2024-12-07T10:04:07Z","timestamp":1733565847000},"page":"330-354","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/sage-journals-update-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Working from Home, COVID-19, and Job Satisfaction"],"prefix":"10.1177","volume":"78","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4912-0356","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Inga","family":"La\u00df","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Esperanza","family":"Vera-Toscano","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mark","family":"Wooden","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Inga La\u00df and Esperanza Vera-Toscano are Senior Research Fellows at the Melbourne Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research, University of Melbourne.
