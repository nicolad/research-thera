We examine the extent to which JobKeeper cushioned employment losses in the first four months of the program. To do this, we use worker-level data from the Labour Force Survey and an identification strategy that exploits a threshold in eligibility to infer causality. We find that one in five employees who received JobKeeper (and, thus, remained employed) would not have remained employed during this period had it not been for the JobKeeper Payment. Given that 3\u00bd million individuals were receiving the payment over the period from April to July 2020, this implies that JobKeeper reduced total employment losses by at least 700,000 over the same period. We discuss the potential sources of bias that might affect our results, some of which stem from the fact that our conclusions are based on a sample of casual employees who may have responded differently to JobKeeper than other workers. Our paper does not consider the longer-run effects of JobKeeper on employment or the indirect channels through which JobKeeper may have affected employment.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.47688\/rdp2020-07","type":"report","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,17]],"date-time":"2022-02-17T04:56:29Z","timestamp":1645073789000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":23,"title":["How Many Jobs Did Jobkeeper Keep?"],"prefix":"10.47688","author":[{"name":"Reserve Bank of Australia","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"James","family":"Bishop","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Iris","family":"Day","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Reserve Bank of Australia","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"27154","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,23]]},"container-title":["RBA Research Discussion Papers"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,2,17]],"date-time":"2022-02-17T04:56:29Z","timestamp":1645073789000},"score":35.170364,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.rba.gov.au\/publications\/rdp\/2020\/2020-07.html"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,23]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.47688\/rdp2020-07","ISSN":["1448-5109"],"issn-type":[{"type":"print","value":"1448-5109"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2020,11,23]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2025,10,11]],"date-time":"2025-10-11T13:36:25Z","timestamp":1760189785675},"reference-count":19,"publisher":"Wiley","issue":"4","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,20]],"date-time":"2021-05-20T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1621468800000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/termsAndConditions#vor"}],"content-domain":{"domain":["onlinelibrary.wiley.com"],"crossmark-restriction":true},"short-container-title":["Aust J Public Adm"],"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2021,12]]},"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>JobKeeper is a short\u2010time work subsidy implemented between March 2020 and March 2021 in Australia during the COVID\u201019 pandemic to reinforce the resilience of the labour market. As a job retention (JR) program, JobKeeper supports businesses, protects jobs and employment relationships and secures income of Australian workers. Drawing on microeconomic and macroeconomic evaluations of the JR programs published in other countries in a pre\u2010pandemic period, this paper studies how the generosity, responsiveness, governance and eligibility criteria of JobKeeper may shape its efficiency and equity. We show that expected benefits of JobKeeper may be limited by some negative economic effects of short\u2010time work subsidies. Locking employees in their current position potentially crowds out more efficient matches on the labour market. These displacement effects may slow down economic recovery. As a wage subsidy, JobKeeper distorts the relative wage and employment prospects between eligible and non\u2010eligible workers. These substitution effects can increase the dualization of the Australian labour market and institutionalise lay\u2010offs inequities for workers holding a temporary visa. Finally, we argue that subsidies for part\u2010time work also generate incentives for working time reorganisations that should be evaluated.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1111\/1467-8500.12495","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,20]],"date-time":"2021-05-20T10:59:01Z","timestamp":1621508341000},"page":"1046-1053","update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1002\/crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":12,"title":["JobKeeper: The Australian Short\u2010Time Work Program"],"prefix":"10.1111","volume":"80","author":[{"given":"Emmanuelle","family":"Walkowiak","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Economics, Finance and Marketing La Trobe University  Melbourne Victoria Australia"}]}],"member":"311","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,20]]},"reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_8_2_1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Bishop J. &Day I.(2020).How many jobs did JobKeeper keep?Discussion Paper of the Reserve Bank of Australia.","DOI":"10.47688\/rdp2020-07"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_3_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1111\/j.1468-0327.2011.271.x"},{"issue":"3","key":"e_1_2_8_4_1","first-page":"131","article-title":"Wage subsidy programs: a primer","volume":"19","author":"Borland J.","year":"2016","journal-title":"Australian Journal of Labour Economics"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_5_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1111\/1467-8462.12386"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_6_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1080\/00220388.2020.1715941"},{"key":"e_1_2_8_7_1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Calavrezo O.
