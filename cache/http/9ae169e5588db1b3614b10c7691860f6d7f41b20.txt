This study involved 110 families (47 stable and 63 shift working hours) from Jabodetabek area, which was selected by non-probability random sampling. Data were collected in April 2020. The results showed that women health workers with stable working hours had significantly higher subjective well-being, financial management, and marriage satisfaction, but otherwise had lower husband-wife interactions and work and family problems than women with shift working hours. The results of the main regression model showed that family well-being was influenced positively by coping strategies, marital satisfaction, and husband's education. Meanwhile, the derivative regression model that analyzes the variable components showed that family well-being was influenced positively by a component of marriage satisfaction, a component of family interaction, implementation of family time management, and husband's education; but negatively influenced by family income and husband's age. In general, the family of women health workers during the Covid-19 pandemic was expected to develop various efforts to increase marriage satisfaction and the family's subjective well-being.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.29244\/jfs.v5i2.33152","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,27]],"date-time":"2021-01-27T07:05:26Z","timestamp":1611731126000},"page":"103-120","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":["Family Subjective Well-Being of Health Workers Women During The Covid-19 Pandemic"],"prefix":"10.29244","volume":"5","author":[{"given":"Euis","family":"Sunarti","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Dinda","family":"Kamilah","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Husniyah","family":"Almas","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Siti","family":"Pitriani","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"11796","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,27]]},"reference":[{"key":"153922","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Achour, M., Nor, M.

During the pandemic, people with high coronavirus stress are at risk of experiencing poor subjective well-being. There is no research investigating the role of meaning-based coping and spirituality in explaining the link between coronavirus stress and subjective well-being. This study examined the mediating roles of meaning-based coping and spiritual well-being in the link between coronavirus stress and subjective well-being in young adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. The sample included 427 young adults (71% female), ranging in age between 18 and 48 years (<jats:italic>M<\/jats:italic>= 21.06;<jats:italic>SD<\/jats:italic>= 2.62). Turkish young adults completed an online survey, including measures of coronavirus stress, subjective well-being, meaning-based coping, and spiritual well-being. The results indicate that greater meaning-based coping and spiritual well-being mediated decreases in the adverse impacts of coronavirus stress on subjective well-being. These results suggest that the importance of a combination of meaning-based coping and spirituality processes mitigate the adverse effects of stress on well-being during the coronavirus pandemic. Interventions focusing on meaning-based coping and spirituality in those experiencing high coronavirus stress are urgently needed to improve the mental health and well-being of young adults.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3389\/fpsyg.2021.646572","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,15]],"date-time":"2021-04-15T16:31:38Z","timestamp":1618504298000},"update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3389\/crossmark-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":55,"title":["Meaning-Based Coping and Spirituality During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Mediating Effects on Subjective Well-Being"],"prefix":"10.3389","volume":"12","author":[{"given":"G\u00f6kmen","family":"Arslan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Murat","family":"Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"1965","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,15]]},"reference":[{"key":"ref1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"306","DOI":"10.1080\/13607863.2019.1697203","article-title":"Spirituality and subjective well-being among Ghanaian older adults: optimism and meaning in life as mediators","volume":"25","author":"Aglozo","year":"2019","journal-title":"Aging Ment.
