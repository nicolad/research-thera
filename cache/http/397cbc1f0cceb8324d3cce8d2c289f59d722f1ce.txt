The public health emergency took urgent efforts to develop resistant vaccine to combat COVID 19 pandemic. The emergency use approval has been granted to COVID 19 vaccines before the completion of conventional phases of clinical vaccine trials. Nevertheless, there are few of comprehensive reviews of safety reported from the vaccine trials. This research examined the mechanism of COVID 19 vaccine and its impact on life\u2019s sustainability. Furthermore, the research aims to provide the consequences of the vaccine trials using trustworthy and reliable sources of information. I searched three major databases (Google Scholar, PubMed and Embase) for published studies and articles between December 2019 and 2021. The researches I have read contained information about the infection itself, the vaccine and the way it works. Furthermore, I have created a survey about the vaccination and 55 volunteers have answered the questions. The analysis of the survey was shown as diagrams and charts. The statistics showed that 50% experienced cough, 37,5% had fever, 64,3 had severe headache, 21,4% had weight loss and 26,8% had breathing difficulties. Furthermore, 55% volunteers felt as usual and did not notice any changes in their well-being, 25% felt the same as during the infection,20% felt better and some of the symptoms started disappearing through the time. Talking about the vaccines, the most acceptable vaccine is Sputnik (30,4%). Novavax is also common among the volunteers (30,2%). Pfizer vaccine was applied to 17,9% and Moderna to 13,6%. 7,9% of volunteers have gone through other types of vaccines. Satisfaction with the vaccine\u2019s impact on volunteer\u2019s well-being is the most essential part of the survey. 25% of volunteers were glad about the vaccine, 25% were satisfied, though they noticed some pitfalls. 25% were not happy about the vaccine outcomes. 19,4% were unsatisfied with the consequences of the vaccine. Finally, 5,6% of volunteers regret about going through vaccination and have negative outcomes. In conclusion, people are frightened of vaccine trials because it is believed to be something unique and dangerous as it is unknown and must be proved on people by trials. A few volunteers have enough courage to take part in various experiments and save the humanity from severe infection. The main conclusion of the research is the evidence that vaccine trials must be held due to their positive results, though not all of them are successful. From the ethical side, human trials are brutal and should not be held because it may impact human\u2019s well-being negatively.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-3867058\/v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,1,17]],"date-time":"2024-01-17T04:21:19Z","timestamp":1705465279000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["How were people affected by vaccination trials during COVID-19 pandemic?"],"prefix":"10.21203","author":[{"given":"Oleinik","family":"Karina","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"NIS CBD high school"}]}],"member":"8761","reference":[{"key":"ref1","unstructured":"Simran Preet Kaur, Vandana Gupta (2020).
