A growing number of studies address this question, but they often lack a comparison group that was unaffected by the pandemic, and the observation window is usually short. Here, we compared the 2-year development of life satisfaction of German high school students during COVID-19 (N\u2005=\u20052,698) with the development in prepandemic cohorts (N\u2005=\u20054,834) with a difference-in-differences design. We found a decline in life satisfaction in winter 2020\/2021 (Cohen\u2019s d\u2005=\u2005-0.40) that was approximately three times stronger than that in the general population and persisted until winter 2021\/2022.
