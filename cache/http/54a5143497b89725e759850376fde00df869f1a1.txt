A key empirical challenge is the endogeneity bias when comparing risk-taking by vaccination status since people choose whether to get vaccinated. To address this bias, we exploit rich survey panel data on individuals followed before and after vaccine availability over fourteen\u00a0months in an event study fixed effects model with individual, time, sector, and county-by-time fixed effects and inverse propensity weights. We find evidence that vaccinated persons, regardless of the timing of vaccination, increase their risk-taking activities. The evidence is consistent with the \u201clulling effect\u201d. While vaccine availability may reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19, it also contributes to further spread of the virus by incentivizing risk-taking in the short term.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1007\/s11166-023-09424-0","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,2,23]],"date-time":"2024-02-23T04:37:01Z","timestamp":1708663021000},"page":"25-49","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["COVID-19 vaccine and risk-taking"],"prefix":"10.1007","volume":"68","author":[{"given":"Shanike J.","family":"Smart","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2976-3402","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Solomon W.","family":"Polachek","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024,2,23]]},"reference":[{"key":"9424_CR1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Agrawal, V., Sood, N., & Whaley, C.

Sociodemographic Data Form, Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), Barratt Impulsivity Scale Short Form (BIS-11-SF), The Scale of Vaccine Hesitancy (SVH), and Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) were administered to the participants.A statistically significant difference was found between the vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups regarding SVH sub-dimensions and the total score (p&lt;0.001). A statistically significant difference was observed between the groups in the IGT-5 sub- dimension (p &lt;0.05). Although there was no statistically significant difference in IGT-total and other sub-dimensions, it was recognized that not-vaccinated participants made more choices for risky decks. A statistically significant negative correlation was found between IGT-5 and the benefit and protective value of the vaccine, solutions for non-vaccination, and SVH-total score. Besides, there was a statistically significant negative correlation between the IGT-Total score and the sub-dimension of solutions for non-vaccination.The non-vaccinated group made more choices from the disadvantageous and risky decks in the long run during the decision-making task under uncertainty; they were prone to take more risks.

Unfortunately, vaccine hesitancy is a major threat to the success of vaccination campaigns. Research on previous pandemics highlighted the centrality of perceived risk and confidence as core determinants of vaccine acceptance. Research on COVID\u201019 is less conclusive, and frequently it relies on one\u2010country, cross\u2010sectional data, thus making it hard to generalize results across contexts and observe these relationships over time. To bridge these gaps, in this article, we analyzed the association between perceived risk, confidence, and vaccine acceptance cross\u2010sectionally at individual and country levels. Then, we longitudinally explored whether a within\u2010country variation in perceived risk and confidence was correlated with a variation in vaccine acceptance. We used data from a large\u2010scale survey of individuals in 23 countries and 19 time\u2010points between June 2020 and March 2021 and comparative longitudinal multilevel models to estimate the associations at different levels of analysis simultaneously. Results show the existence of cross\u2010sectional relationships at the individual and country levels but no significant associations within countries over time. This article contributes to our understanding of the roles of risk perception and confidence in COVID\u201019 vaccines\u2019 acceptance by underlining that these relationships might differ at diverse levels of analysis. To foster vaccine uptake, it might be important to address individual concerns and persisting contextual characteristics, but increasing levels of perceived risk and confidence might not be a sufficient strategy to increase vaccine acceptance rates.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1111\/risa.14200","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,27]],"date-time":"2023-07-27T07:23:26Z","timestamp":1690442606000},"page":"802-816","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":8,"title":["COVID\u201019 vaccine acceptance: A comparative longitudinal analysis of the association between risk perception, confidence, and the acceptance of a COVID\u201019 vaccine"],"prefix":"10.1111","volume":"44","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6178-779X","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Mauro","family":"Martinelli","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Sociology University of Copenhagen K\u00f8benhavn Denmark"}]},{"given":"Giuseppe A.","family":"Veltri","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Sociology and Social Research University of Trento Trento Italy"}]}],"member":"311","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,27]]},"reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_9_2_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.3389\/fpsyg.2021.619145"},{"key":"e_1_2_9_3_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1007\/s11673\u2010016\u20109756\u20107"},{"key":"e_1_2_9_4_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1136\/bmjopen\u20102020\u2010046127"},{"key":"e_1_2_9_5_1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0049806"},{"key":"e_1_2_9_6_1","unstructured":"Barkay N.

This survey compares the burden of illness for individuals with a history of Lyme disease (HLD) with individuals with a HLD who have either contracted COVID-19 or who have taken the COVID-19 vaccine. The findings describe the relative symptom burden among these three groups using a cross-sectional descriptive survey investigating the burden of Lyme disease in a pandemic. The survey includes the General Symptom Questionnaire-30 (GSQ-30), a brief self-report scale designed to assess the symptom burden in Lyme disease (LD). The results of this survey show that the overall burden of illness among individuals with HLD is not significantly different after contracting COVID-19 or after COVID-19 vaccination. A new survey will be needed to better understand why one in five individuals with a HLD reported long COVID after contracting COVID-19. These results should help clinicians and their patients to discuss the consequences of contracting a COVID-19 infection or being vaccinated against COVID-19.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3390\/antibiotics12030493","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,2]],"date-time":"2023-03-02T03:29:00Z","timestamp":1677727740000},"page":"493","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/mdpi_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["Consequences of Contracting COVID-19 or Taking the COVID-19 Vaccine for Individuals with a History of Lyme Disease"],"prefix":"10.3390","volume":"12","author":[{"given":"Daniel J.","family":"Cameron","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Northern Westchester Hospital, Mt.
