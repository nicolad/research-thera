However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, additional attention has been brought to the topic of vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy is a threat to the population\u2019s health globally. This article aims to acquire insights from previous literature to determine what works to increase vaccine uptake and how we can apply this knowledge to increase COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Research has focused chiefly on childhood vaccination and the hesitancy of caregivers. After conducting an extensive literature review, we have created a conceptual model of indicators that influence vaccine uptake for health providers and caregivers, which can also be used for vaccine recipients. Overall, the reasons for vaccine hesitancy are complex; therefore, a multifaceted approach is needed to address it. Understanding the factors that affect vaccine hesitancy will aid in addressing hesitancy and, in turn, lead to an increase in vaccine uptake.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3390\/vaccines10010080","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,9]],"date-time":"2022-01-09T23:35:09Z","timestamp":1641771309000},"page":"80","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/mdpi_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":29,"title":["What Determines Vaccine Hesitancy: Recommendations from Childhood Vaccine Hesitancy to Address COVID-19 Vaccine Hesitancy"],"prefix":"10.3390","volume":"10","author":[{"given":"Farren","family":"Rodrigues","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Dornsife School of Public Health, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA"}]},{"given":"Suzanne","family":"Block","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Dornsife School of Public Health, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA"}]},{"given":"Suruchi","family":"Sood","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Dornsife School of Public Health, Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA"}]}],"member":"1968","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,6]]},"reference":[{"key":"ref_1","unstructured":"World Health Organization (2021, November 10).
