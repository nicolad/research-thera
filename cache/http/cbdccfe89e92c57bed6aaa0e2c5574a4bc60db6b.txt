We examine the ways in which COVID-19 affect organizational communication by analyzing five months of calendar and messaging metadata from a technology company. We found that: (i) cross-level communication increased more than that of same-level, (ii) while within-team messaging increased considerably, meetings stayed the same, (iii) off-hours messaging became much more frequent, and that this effect was stronger for women; (iv) employees respond to non-managers faster than managers; finally, (v) the number of short meetings increased while long meetings decreased. These findings contribute to theories on organizational communication, remote work, management, and flexibility stigma. Besides, this study exemplifies a strategy to measure organizational health using an objective (not self-report based) method. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using workplace communication metadata to examine the heterogeneous effects of mandatory remote work.<\/p>","DOI":"10.31235\/osf.io\/hjre6","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,24]],"date-time":"2020-10-24T11:57:38Z","timestamp":1603540658000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Exploring the Impact of Mandatory Remote Work during the COVID-19 Pandemic"],"prefix":"10.31235","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6797-2010","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Talha","family":"Oz","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5034-6654","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Andrew","family":"Crooks","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"15934","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2025,11,17]],"date-time":"2025-11-17T04:37:50Z","timestamp":1763354270000},"score":30.651234,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/osf.io\/hjre6_v1"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,24]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31235\/osf.io\/hjre6","published":{"date-parts":[[2020,10,24]]},"subtype":"preprint"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2025,6,28]],"date-time":"2025-06-28T19:00:49Z","timestamp":1751137249245},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Demeter Press","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,1]]},"DOI":"10.2307\/j.ctv1h45mcj.6","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,3]],"date-time":"2021-03-03T20:30:15Z","timestamp":1614803415000},"page":"41-52","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["\u201cCertainly Not an Equal-Opportunity Pandemic\u201d:"],"prefix":"10.2307","author":[{"given":"Andrea","family":"O\u2019Reilly","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"1121","container-title":["Mothers, Mothering, and COVID-19"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,3]],"date-time":"2021-03-03T20:31:23Z","timestamp":1614803483000},"score":28.71315,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"http:\/\/www.jstor.org\/stable\/10.2307\/j.ctv1h45mcj.6"}},"subtitle":["COVID-19 and Its Impact on Mothers\u2019 Carework, Health, and Employment"],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,1]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.2307\/j.ctv1h45mcj.6","published":{"date-parts":[[2021,3,1]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2026,1,9]],"date-time":"2026-01-09T01:57:17Z","timestamp":1767923837098,"version":"3.49.0"},"reference-count":10,"publisher":"University of Toronto Press Inc.

We complement this finding with labour microdata and document facts on the relationship between the feasibility of remote work and income inequality, gender, age, and other worker characteristics. We then show that workers in occupations for which the possibility of remote work is less likely experienced larger employment losses between March and April. This relationship also holds for employment losses across cities and (in one of the specifications) across industries. Across provinces, there is a negative link in the February\u2013March 2020 variation. <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3138\/cpp.2020-026","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,5,28]],"date-time":"2020-05-28T15:25:28Z","timestamp":1590679528000},"page":"S44-S54","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":99,"title":["Remote Work and Employment Dynamics under COVID-19: Evidence from Canada"],"prefix":"10.3138","volume":"46","author":[{"given":"Guillermo","family":"Gallacher","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Economics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba"}]},{"given":"Iqbal","family":"Hossain","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Economics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Manitoba"}]}],"member":"1696","reference":[{"key":"r1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.3138\/cpp.2018-030"},{"key":"r2","volume-title":"StatCan COVID-19: Data to Insights for a Better Canada","author":"Deng Z.","year":"2020"},{"key":"r3","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","DOI":"10.3386\/w26948","volume-title":"How Many Jobs Can Be Done at Home?","author":"Dingel J.I.","year":"2020"},{"key":"r4","volume-title":"Documentos de Trabajo del CEDLAS","author":"Foschiatti C.B.","year":"2020"},{"key":"r5","volume-title":"Labor Demand in the Time of COVID-19: Evidence from Vacancy Postings and UI Claims","author":"Kahn L.B.","year":"2020"},{"key":"r6","unstructured":"Lange, F., and C.
