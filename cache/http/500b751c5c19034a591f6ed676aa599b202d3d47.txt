Our analysis compares the effects of the pandemic for displaced and non-displaced citizens, controlling for individual and household characteristics and geo-localized measures of economic activity and conflict intensity. In our sample, 9.5% of respondents report that a household member has been infected by COVID-19, while 24.7% of them have suffered economic damages and 14.6% have experienced negative health effects due to the pandemic. IDPs do not display higher incidence of COVID-19 relative to comparable non-displaced individuals, but are about 60% more likely to report negative economic and health impacts caused by the pandemic. We provide suggestive evidence that the larger damages suffered by IDPs can be explained by their weaker economic status\u2014which leads to more food insecurity and indebtedness\u2014and by the discrimination they face in accessing health care.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017\/dem.2023.13","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,25]],"date-time":"2023-10-25T08:47:41Z","timestamp":1698223661000},"page":"460-485","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Facing displacement and a global pandemic: evidence from a fragile state"],"prefix":"10.1017","volume":"90","author":[{"given":"Michele","family":"Di Maio","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Francesco","family":"Fasani","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Valerio","family":"Leone Sciabolazza","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Vasco","family":"Molini","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"56","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,25]]},"reference":[{"key":"S2054089223000135_ref39","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/0022343310378914"},{"key":"S2054089223000135_ref18","unstructured":"Gentilini, U. , Almenfi, M. , Orton, I. and Dale, P.
