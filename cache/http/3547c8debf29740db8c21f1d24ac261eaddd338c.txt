Using EU microdata from 2003 to 2018, we show that such schemes are associated with lower job separation rates, especially among lower-productivity workers. We build a search-and-matching model with occupational choice, calibrated to the United Kingdom during the global financial and sovereign debt crises. Simulations show that a retention policy scheme aimed at reducing unemployment by nearly 1 percentage point would have been both welfare-enhancing and cost-effective. Average welfare would have increased by 0.06 percent in consumption-equivalent terms, with low-income workers benefiting more than twice as much as the median worker by avoiding costly job switches and unemployment spells.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.5089\/9798229037884.001","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2026,1,30]],"date-time":"2026-01-30T16:50:06Z","timestamp":1769791806000},"page":"1","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The Welfare Implications of Job Retention Schemes"],"prefix":"10.5089","volume":"2026","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1200-8427","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"John","family":"Bluedorn","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jorge","family":"Mondragon","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3984-4676","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Ippei","family":"Shibata","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0426-3655","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Marina","family":"Mendes Tavares","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"3029","container-title":["IMF Working Papers"],"original-title":[],"language":"en","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2026,1,30]],"date-time":"2026-01-30T22:45:10Z","timestamp":1769813110000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/elibrary.imf.org\/view\/journals\/001\/2026\/015\/001.2026.issue-015-en.xml?cid=573549-com-dsp-crossref"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2026,1]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"015","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2026,1]]}},"alternative-id":["001A001"],"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5089\/9798229037884.001","relation":{},"ISSN":["1018-5941"],"issn-type":[{"value":"1018-5941","type":"print"}],"subject":[],"published":{"date-parts":[[2026,1]]}}}
