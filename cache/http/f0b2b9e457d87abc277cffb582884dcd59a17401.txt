Physical distancing and shelter-in-place public health responses designed to curb COVID-19 transmission has led to concerns over elevated risk of loneliness. Given that physical isolation does not necessitate social isolation in the age of digital communication, this study investigated the relationship between the frequency of social interaction and loneliness over a two-week period in people engaging in physical distancing, and examined whether this relationship was moderated by physical isolation level, age, or depression. A self-selected sample of N = 469 individuals across Australia who were engaged in physically distanced living completed daily surveys for 14-days during April to June of 2020. Multilevel modelling showed that more frequent social interaction with close, but not intermediate or distant contacts, was uniquely associated with lower loneliness. In addition, being younger, more depressed, more anxious, or having a mental health condition diagnosis (past or present) were also independently associated with higher loneliness. Critically, depression was the only significant moderator of the relationship between social interaction and loneliness over time, where more frequent social interaction with close contacts buffered against loneliness over time in high depression individuals only. The findings suggest that encouraging social activity with close contacts may promote resilience against loneliness in individuals with elevated depression symptoms.<\/p>","DOI":"10.31234\/osf.io\/ejdmp","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,11]],"date-time":"2021-09-11T04:52:48Z","timestamp":1631335968000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Social activity promotes resilience against loneliness in depressed individuals: A study over 14-days of physical isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia"],"prefix":"10.31234","author":[{"given":"Julie Lin","family":"Ji","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3686-8720","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Julian","family":"Basanovic","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2407-7339","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Colin","family":"MacLeod","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"15934","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2025,11,21]],"date-time":"2025-11-21T00:44:20Z","timestamp":1763685860000},"score":31.418537,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/osf.io\/ejdmp_v1"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,11]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/ejdmp","relation":{"is-preprint-of":[{"id-type":"doi","id":"10.1038\/s41598-022-11315-4","asserted-by":"subject"}]},"published":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,11]]},"subtype":"preprint"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2025,11,27]],"date-time":"2025-11-27T00:36:56Z","timestamp":1764203816928,"version":"3.46.0"},"posted":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,23]]},"group-title":"PsyArXiv","reference-count":0,"publisher":"Center for Open Science","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,23]],"date-time":"2021-05-23T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1621728000000},"content-version":"unspecified","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0\/legalcode"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"abstract":"<p>The outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic has drastically altered people\u2019s lives. Loneliness and social isolation were publicly discussed as possible psychological consequences of the measures taken to slow the virus spread. These public discussions have sparked a surge in empirical studies on loneliness and social isolation. In this study, we first provide a systematic review synthesizing recent literature on the prevalence and correlates of loneliness and social isolation during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (k = 53 studies). We found that most quantitative studies included in the systematic review were cross-sectional. The few longitudinal studies mainly reported increases in loneliness, especially when the pre-pandemic measurement occasions were months or years before the COVID-19 pandemic. Studies with pre-pandemic measures weeks or days before the pandemic reported relatively stable or even decreasing loneliness trends. Second, we enrich the systematic review with an empirical investigation on daily changes in the perceived quality and quantity of social relationships during the pandemic compared to before the pandemic (N = 4,823). This empirical investigation showed that, on average, the quality of social relationships was perceived worse during the pandemic than before. This perception got slightly stronger over the first two weeks of the pandemic but stagnated thereafter. Regarding the quantity of social relationships, participants reported on average that they had fewer social interactions at the beginning of the study than before the pandemic. This perceived reduction in the quantity of social interactions linearly decreased over time.<\/p>","DOI":"10.31234\/osf.io\/3dwxq","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,23]],"date-time":"2021-05-23T12:58:56Z","timestamp":1621774736000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":5,"title":["Loneliness and social isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic: A systematic review enriched with empirical evidence from a large-scale diary study"],"prefix":"10.31234","author":[{"given":"Susanne","family":"Buecker","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Kai Tobias","family":"Horstmann","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"15934","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2025,11,27]],"date-time":"2025-11-27T00:33:15Z","timestamp":1764203595000},"score":30.532505,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/osf.io\/3dwxq_v1"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,23]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31234\/osf.io\/3dwxq","published":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,23]]},"subtype":"preprint"},{"institution":[{"name":"medRxiv"}],"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2026,1,16]],"date-time":"2026-01-16T08:01:59Z","timestamp":1768550519355,"version":"3.49.0"},"posted":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,2]]},"group-title":"Public and Global Health","reference-count":29,"publisher":"openRxiv","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"accepted":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,6]]},"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>Reduced mobility during Covid-19 lockdowns means fewer vehicles at risk of collision, but also an opportunity to speed on empty streets. Other collision risk factors that have changed during the pandemic include alcohol consumption, sleeping patterns, distraction, unemployment and economic uncertainty. Evidence on the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on motor vehicle collisions is scarce, as such statistics are often released with a delay. The objective of this paper is to examine the impact of the first wave of the pandemic and the first lockdown on motor vehicle collisions and associated injuries and deaths in Greece. Using monthly data at the regional unit level, I provide descriptive evidence and subsequently follow a difference-in-difference econometric approach, comparing trends in 2020 to those of the previous five years while controlling for unemployment and petrol prices. I found a steep decline in collisions, injuries and deaths compared to what would have been otherwise expected. In March and April 2020, there were about 1,226 fewer collisions, 72 fewer deaths, 40 fewer serious injuries and 1,426 fewer minor injuries compared to what would have been expected in the absence of the pandemic.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1101\/2020.12.26.20248883","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,1,3]],"date-time":"2021-01-03T03:50:11Z","timestamp":1609645811000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":6,"title":["Covid-19, Lockdowns and Motor Vehicle Collisions: Empirical Evidence from Greece"],"prefix":"10.64898","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-9458-4988","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sotiris","family":"Vandoros","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"54368","reference":[{"key":"2021010809153320000_2020.12.26.20248883v2.1","unstructured":"Chudik A , Mohaddes K , Perasan MH , Raissi M , Rebucci A. 2020.

The findings suggest that encouraging social activity with close contacts may promote resilience against loneliness in individuals with elevated depression symptoms.\n                  <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1038\/s41598-022-11315-4","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,3]],"date-time":"2022-05-03T08:03:54Z","timestamp":1651565034000},"update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":11,"title":["Social activity promotes resilience against loneliness in depressed individuals: a study over 14-days of physical isolation during the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia"],"prefix":"10.1038","volume":"12","author":[{"given":"Julie L.","family":"Ji","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Julian","family":"Basanovic","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Colin","family":"MacLeod","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,3]]},"reference":[{"key":"11315_CR1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"TMGH-Global COVID-19 Collaborative.
