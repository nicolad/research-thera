We find that the pandemic had an adverse effect on the labour market outcomes for all workers, and that the adverse effects were generally larger for immigrants and especially recent immigrants as well as for immigrants at the bottom of the outcome distributions. The adverse effects were generally larger at the earliest waves of the pandemic, and for recent immigrants who were female, less educated, and those with child responsibilities, and for jobs at greater risk of contact with the pandemic. <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3138\/cpp.2021-043","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,25]],"date-time":"2022-05-25T16:12:15Z","timestamp":1653495135000},"page":"473-490","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":["The Differential Impact of COVID-19 on Labour Market Outcomes of Immigrants in Canada"],"prefix":"10.3138","volume":"48","author":[{"given":"Tingting","family":"Zhang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Labor and Employment Relations, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, Champaign, Illinois, United States"}]},{"given":"Morley","family":"Gunderson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Centre for Industrial Relations and Human Resources and Department of Economics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada"}]}],"member":"1696","reference":[{"volume-title":"The New Hazardous Jobs and Worker Reallocation","year":"2020","author":"Basso G.","key":"r1"},{"volume-title":"America\u2019s Newcomers and the Dynamics of Diversity","year":"2003","author":"Bean F.D.","key":"r2"},{"key":"r3","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.3138\/cpp.2020-119"},{"volume-title":"The Short-Term Economic Consequences of COVID-19: Occupation Tasks and Mental Health in Canada","year":"2020","author":"B\u00e9land L.P.","key":"r4"},{"key":"r5","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.3138\/cpp.2020-076"},{"key":"r6","unstructured":"B\u00e9land, L.P., O.
