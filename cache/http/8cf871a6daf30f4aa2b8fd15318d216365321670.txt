Using a probit model, it finds that regardless of educational attainment, women with school-age children face a lower probability of being on paid employment, but the same cannot be observed among men with school-age children. The Heckman model was applied to estimate the log of hours of work. Conditional on employment, it was observed that school closures do not significantly determine the log of hours of work for both men and women with school-age children. However, further disaggregating the estimates by education reveals that female college graduates\u2014and, to some extent, male college graduates\u2014with school-age children tend to work more hours during school closures. In contrast, school closures do not affect the work hours of less educated men and women with children. Overall, the results suggest that school closures have a negative effect on employment at the extensive margin for women, but there is no evidence of reduced labor supply at the intensive margins. Policies aimed at preserving employment and mitigating human capital deterioration can thus address the cost of school closures on women\u2019s labor supply.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.62986\/dp2023.26","type":"report","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,8,29]],"date-time":"2024-08-29T11:45:21Z","timestamp":1724931921000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["School Closures and Parental Labor Supply"],"prefix":"10.62986","author":[{"name":"Philippine Institute for Development Studies","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ma.

Using nationally representative bi-monthly panel data, the analysis compares changes in outcomes after schools partially reopened in October 2020 for households with children in a grade eligible to return against those with children in adjacent grades. An adolescent returning to school increases adults\u2019 weekly work by 4.3\u00a0hours (27 percent) in the short run, concentrated among the most flexible margins of adjustment and particularly household agriculture. Contrary to evidence from high-income settings, overall effects are not gendered. There are no effects of the partial reopening on respondent childcare hours and heterogeneity in labor-supply effects by household characteristics does not align with predictions based on a childcare mechanism. Instead, the results indicate that increased adult work hours substitute for reduced child work in household agriculture as a child goes back to school. Impacts on labor supply are driven by less wealthy households with children engaged in household agriculture, while wealthier agricultural households substitute child labor with increased hired labor. The results show that adolescent schooling has important consequences for household production and labor-supply decisions. Poor agricultural households face particularly high opportunity costs for children\u2019s education.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1093\/wber\/lhaf021","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,8,2]],"date-time":"2025-08-02T11:43:49Z","timestamp":1754135029000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Adolescent Schooling and Adult Labor Supply: Evidence from COVID-19 School Closures and Reopenings in Kenya"],"prefix":"10.1093","author":[{"given":"Pierre E","family":"Biscaye","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Universit\u00e9 Clermont Auvergne, CERDI, CNRS, IRD"}]},{"given":"Dennis","family":"Egger","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Oxford"}]},{"given":"Utz J","family":"Pape","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"World Bank and Georg-August-University G\u00f6ttingen"}]}],"member":"286","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2025,8,13]]},"reference":[{"issue":"2","key":"2025081306130200100_bib1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"167","DOI":"10.1016\/S0738-0593(02)00012-3","article-title":"Child Labour and Schooling in the Context of a Subsistence Rural Economy: Can They Be Compatible?","volume":"23","author":"Admassie","year":"2003","journal-title":"International Journal of Educational Development"},{"key":"2025081306130200100_bib2","first-page":"454","article-title":"Who Uses Childcare Centers?

We examine whether and how low-skilled immigration due to the Mariel Boatlift immigration event in 1980, which caused a sudden and exogenous shock to the Miami labor market, affected native women\u2019s labor supply. To understand the underlying mechanism, we build a general equilibrium model incorporating final goods, household services, and labor markets, thereby illustrating the pathways through which low-skilled immigration influences native womens labor supply. Using metropolitan-level data and the synthetic difference-indifferences estimation method, we find that the Mariel Boatlift immigration event increased the working hours of high-skilled women, while decreasing those of low-skilled women. Our results suggest that low-skilled immigration improves the availability of household services and, hence, contributes to achieving women\u2019s empowerment and shrinking the gender gap in labor market outcomes for high-skilled women, but simultaneously widens inequality across women with different skills.\nJEL classification: D13; J16; J61<\/p>","DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-6257195\/v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,3,25]],"date-time":"2025-03-25T10:39:57Z","timestamp":1742899197000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The effect of low-skilled immigration on women\u2019s labor supply: Theory and evidence from the United States\u2020"],"prefix":"10.21203","author":[{"given":"Ryo","family":"Sakamoto","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Osaka University"}]},{"given":"Takuma","family":"Sugiyama","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Kobe University"}]}],"member":"297","link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchsquare.com\/article\/rs-6257195\/v1","content-type":"text\/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchsquare.com\/article\/rs-6257195\/v1.html","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2025,6,16]],"date-time":"2025-06-16T14:39:28Z","timestamp":1750084768000},"score":36.2081,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchsquare.com\/article\/rs-6257195\/v1"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2025,3,25]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.21203\/rs.3.rs-6257195\/v1","published":{"date-parts":[[2025,3,25]]},"subtype":"preprint"}],"items-per-page":5,"query":{"start-index":0,"search-terms":null}}}
