One of the key affected areas was the academic sector, especially since schools had to be closed to protect students from contracting the disease. The fundamental purpose of this study was to assess the impact of shutting down schools on the emotional aspects of high school students. To measure this impact, we conducted an online survey. We found that factors such as lack of face-to-face interaction due to remote learning, e-learning challenges including inconsistent network connectivity, and uncertainties experienced during the pandemic had adverse effects on high school students\u2019 emotions. The emotions commonly identified in this group were fear and anxiety. Analyzing the patterns and problems that occurred during this unprecedented time, will allow for more focused improvements toward emotional health for teens in the future.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.59720\/21-076","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,30]],"date-time":"2023-09-30T12:51:22Z","timestamp":1696078282000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["COVID-19 pandemic impact on emotional aspects of high school students"],"prefix":"10.59720","author":[{"given":"Shruti","family":"Mahesh","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Subbha","family":"Rajamani","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"39001","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"container-title":["Journal of Emerging Investigators"],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/emerginginvestigators.org\/articles\/21-076\/pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2023,12,11]],"date-time":"2023-12-11T16:21:49Z","timestamp":1702311709000},"score":32.217342,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/emerginginvestigators.org\/articles\/21-076"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.59720\/21-076","published":{"date-parts":[[2022]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2024,2,10]],"date-time":"2024-02-10T00:40:10Z","timestamp":1707525610488},"reference-count":21,"publisher":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2024,1,7]]},"DOI":"10.7759\/cureus.51790","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,1,7]],"date-time":"2024-01-07T14:14:40Z","timestamp":1704636880000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The Impact of COVID-19 on Medical Education: A Lost Generation of Ophthalmologists?"],"prefix":"10.7759","author":[{"given":"Janvi","family":"Karia","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Ishika","family":"Bansal","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Swapnil","family":"Parmar","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","reference":[{"key":"ref1","unstructured":"Coronavirus. a history of \u2018lockdown laws\u2019 in England.

The actual condition of the academic impact of online mathematics learning is necessary to be revealed immediately. This information can be used as a basis for teachers designing and implementing mathematics learning to minimize or eliminate the negative impact of online learning. This study involved 507 public junior high school students distributed over four public schools in Singaraja City as the sample. This study used a questionnaire instrument consisting of 14 items, and the data were tabulated based on the responses entered on the google form. The study results showed that students experienced several academic impacts as a result of online learning of mathematics. The academic impacts that students most felt among others: the amount of mathematics material was hard to understand, students doubted the accountability of the grade obtained by their friends, decreased enthusiasm for learning, and students felt that their academic abilities were e not optimal. The conclusion obtained from this study is that online mathematics learning\u00a0 during COVID-19 had an academic impact on public junior high school students in Singaraja City.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.29408\/jel.v8i1.4517","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,5]],"date-time":"2022-01-05T19:42:29Z","timestamp":1641411749000},"page":"131-143","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.29408\/jel.crossmark","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The academic impact of online mathematics learning during COVID-19 for junior high school students"],"prefix":"10.29408","volume":"8","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2996-6648","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"I Putu Wisna","family":"Ariawan","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"11939","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,6]]},"container-title":["Jurnal Elemen"],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/e-journal.hamzanwadi.ac.id\/index.php\/jel\/article\/download\/4517\/pdf","content-type":"application\/pdf","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/e-journal.hamzanwadi.ac.id\/index.php\/jel\/article\/download\/4517\/pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2024,3,19]],"date-time":"2024-03-19T02:45:56Z","timestamp":1710816356000},"score":29.714714,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/e-journal.hamzanwadi.ac.id\/index.php\/jel\/article\/view\/4517"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,6]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"1","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,6]]}},"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.29408\/jel.v8i1.4517","ISSN":["2442-4226"],"issn-type":[{"type":"electronic","value":"2442-4226"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2022,1,6]]},"assertion":[{"value":"2021-11-18","order":0,"name":"received","label":"Received","group":{"name":"publication_history","label":"Publication History"}},{"value":"2021-12-05","order":1,"name":"revised","label":"Revised","group":{"name":"publication_history","label":"Publication History"}},{"value":"2021-12-09","order":2,"name":"accepted","label":"Accepted","group":{"name":"publication_history","label":"Publication History"}},{"value":"2022-01-06","order":3,"name":"published","label":"Published","group":{"name":"publication_history","label":"Publication History"}}]}],"items-per-page":5,"query":{"start-index":0,"search-terms":null}}}
