To identify the impact, we compare labor market stocks and labor market flows over four quarters for a set of balanced panel samples of comparable workers before and after the pandemic. We find that the pandemic has negatively affected the labor market status of both men and women, but that the effect is significantly stronger for women, magnifying the already large gender gaps that characterize LAC countries. The main channel through which this stronger impact is taking place is the increase in child care work affecting women with school-age children.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.18235\/0004490","type":"report","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,6]],"date-time":"2022-10-06T12:32:07Z","timestamp":1665059527000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":["The COVID-19 Pandemic in Latin American and Caribbean countries: The Labor Supply Impact by Gender"],"prefix":"10.18235","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6449-8707","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Mariana","family":"Viollaz","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mauricio","family":"Salazar-Saenz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2339-7691","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Luca","family":"Flabbi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Monserrat","family":"Bustelo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mariano","family":"Bosch","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"7526","container-title":[],"original-title":[],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2025,7,14]],"date-time":"2025-07-14T14:09:22Z","timestamp":1752502162000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/publications.iadb.org\/en\/covid-19-pandemic-latin-american-and-caribbean-countries-labor-supply-impact-gender"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,29]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.18235\/0004490","relation":{},"subject":[],"published":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,29]]}}}
