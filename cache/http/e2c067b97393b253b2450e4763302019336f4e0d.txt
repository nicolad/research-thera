Gender inequality has many dimensions which are intricately related to the socioeconomic structure of the country. The chapter highlights two dominant factors leading to gender inequality in the country \u2013 education and employment. Empirical evidence suggests that the gross enrollment of females decreases from the upper primary level of schooling onwards. Moreover, higher education for women has not translated to higher employment post liberalization. India continues to be a country with one of the poorest female work participation ratios. Employment along with education is a key tool to improve the condition of women in our society. The chapter concludes that an integrated approach linking education of women and employment is essential for the reduction of gender inequality.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1108\/978-1-83753-180-620231008","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,7,31]],"date-time":"2023-07-31T01:46:25Z","timestamp":1690767985000},"page":"79-90","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Gender Inequality in India Intertwined Between Education and Employment"],"prefix":"10.1108","author":[{"given":"Dyuti","family":"Chatterjee","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"aThe Heritage College, India"}]},{"given":"Pallabi","family":"Banerjee","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"2Independent Researcher, Former Junior Consultant at Census Operations, Kolkata"}]}],"member":"140","reference":[{"key":"2025122912211388900_i978-1-83753-180-620231008_4.bib2","unstructured":"Bandyopadhyay, M., & Subrahmanian, R.
