Through observational data, media reporting, reviews, and interviews, the chapter gives a critical account of the harsh reality of triage during the early context of the pandemic in different countries with different healthcare systems. More or less explicit triage took place almost everywhere, often disguised into suboptimal care; excess mortality in nursing homes was a global phenomenon; countries who did well at the beginning were overwhelmed later. Finally, the chapter attempts to draw some lessons for future pandemics by learning from these cross-cultural experiences how to build trust and accountability to increase public support in situations of scarcity and uncertainty.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1093\/oso\/9780192871688.003.0013","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,4,20]],"date-time":"2023-04-20T08:46:42Z","timestamp":1681980402000},"page":"248-274","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Tragic Choices during the COVID-19 Pandemic"],"prefix":"10.1093","author":[{"given":"Kristina","family":"Orfali","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"286","reference":[{"volume-title":"The Long COVID Report","year":"2021","key":"2024060508473261600_oso-9780192871688-chapter-13-bibItem-1"},{"key":"2024060508473261600_oso-9780192871688-chapter-13-bibItem-2","article-title":"Mortality Rate from COVID-19 Is Substantially Worse Than Europe\u2019s","author":"","year":"2020","journal-title":"VoxEU"},{"key":"2024060508473261600_oso-9780192871688-chapter-13-bibItem-3","article-title":"Attityder och beteende under COVID pandemin\u2019,","author":"","year":"2021","journal-title":"Ekonomiskdebatt"},{"key":"2024060508473261600_oso-9780192871688-chapter-13-bibItem-4","article-title":"COVID and CopMich, comparing and contrasting COVID-19 experiences in the USA and in Scandinavia, Nature Reviews\u2019,","author":"","year":"2020","journal-title":"Urology"},{"volume-title":"Rapport N\u00b0 3053,","author":"","key":"2024060508473261600_oso-9780192871688-chapter-13-bibItem-5"},{"key":"2024060508473261600_oso-9780192871688-chapter-13-bibItem-6","article-title":"At the top of the COVID -19 curve: how do hospitals decide who gets treatment","author":"","year":"2020","journal-title":"New York Times"},{"key":"2024060508473261600_oso-9780192871688-chapter-13-bibItem-7","article-title":"COVID: un h\u00f4pital \u00e0 corps et a tri","author":"","year":"2022","journal-title":"Canard Enchain\u00e9"},{"key":"2024060508473261600_oso-9780192871688-chapter-13-bibItem-8","article-title":"Emancipatory catastrophism: What does it mean to climate change and risk society?\u2019","author":"","year":"2015","journal-title":"Current Sociology"},{"key":"2024060508473261600_oso-9780192871688-chapter-13-bibItem-9","article-title":"Ethical Framework for Health Care Institutions and Guidelines for Institutional Ethics Services Responding to the Novel Coronavirus Pandemic\u2019,","author":"","year":"2020","journal-title":"The Hastings Center"},{"volume-title":"Paris-Match","year":"2020","author":"","key":"2024060508473261600_oso-9780192871688-chapter-13-bibItem-10"},{"volume-title":"Governing the Pandemic: The Politics of Navigating a Mega-Crisis","year":"2020","author":"","key":"2024060508473261600_oso-9780192871688-chapter-13-bibItem-11"},{"key":"2024060508473261600_oso-9780192871688-chapter-13-bibItem-12","unstructured":"British Medical Association (2020), \u2018COVID-19- Ethical Issues.
