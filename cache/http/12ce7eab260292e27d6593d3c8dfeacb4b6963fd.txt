The unemployed population contains two groups---those with jobs and those without jobs. Those with jobs are on furlough or temporary layoff. This group expanded tremendously in April 2020. They wait out periods of non-work with the understanding that their jobs still exist and that they will be recalled. We show that the resulting temporary-layoff unemployment dissipates quickly following a spike. Potential workers without jobs constitute what we call jobless unemployment. Shocks that elevate jobless unemployment have much more persistent effects. Historical major adverse shocks, such as the financial crisis in 2008, created mostly jobless unemployment and consequently caused extended periods of elevated unemployment. The pandemic of 2020 created a large volume of temporary-layoff unemployment, mostly starting in April. It was mostly dissipated by the end of 2020. It also created a bulge in jobless unemployment.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.24148\/wp2021-17","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,16]],"date-time":"2021-07-16T23:08:27Z","timestamp":1626476907000},"page":"01-24","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The Unemployed with Jobs and without Jobs"],"prefix":"10.24148","author":[{"name":"Hoover Institution","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Robert E.","family":"Hall","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Stanford University, Department of Economics","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Marianna","family":"Kudlyak","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"name":"CEPR","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"10243","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,8]]},"container-title":["Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, Working Paper Series"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2024,4,25]],"date-time":"2024-04-25T22:26:23Z","timestamp":1714083983000},"score":38.433395,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.frbsf.org\/research-and-insights\/publications\/working-papers\/2022\/02\/the-unemployed-with-jobs-and-without-jobs\/"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,8]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24148\/wp2021-17","published":{"date-parts":[[2021,7,8]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2024,9,12]],"date-time":"2024-09-12T16:26:10Z","timestamp":1726158370691},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"The MIT Press","isbn-type":[{"type":"electronic","value":"9780262368223"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,29]]},"DOI":"10.7551\/mitpress\/13930.003.0003","type":"other","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,29]],"date-time":"2022-03-29T16:10:50Z","timestamp":1648570250000},"page":"ix-xxxviii","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Introduction: Work without Jobs Is the New Work Operating System"],"prefix":"10.7551","member":"281","container-title":["Work without Jobs"],"language":"en","link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/direct.mit.edu\/books\/book\/chapter-pdf\/2407288\/f000400_9780262368223.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,26]],"date-time":"2024-06-26T21:02:24Z","timestamp":1719435744000},"score":35.115425,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/direct.mit.edu\/books\/book\/5300\/chapter\/3724261\/Introduction-Work-without-Jobs-Is-the-New-Work"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,29]]},"ISBN":["9780262368223"],"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.7551\/mitpress\/13930.003.0003","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,29]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2024,5,13]],"date-time":"2024-05-13T19:25:43Z","timestamp":1715628343013},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Cornell University Press","isbn-type":[{"value":"9781501763991","type":"print"},{"value":"9781501764011","type":"electronic"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,15]]},"abstract":"<p>This chapter discusses the early attempts to advocate for the unemployed. It reveals the early disdain for the unemployed during the Warren Harding administration and how this began to shift over time. The chapter shows that the Harding Conference provided demonstrable public recognition that in an industrial economy the unemployed deserved attention and needed assistance. Though the deep but brief postwar recession would end, and the U.S. economy would prosper as never before, labor leaders, academics, and a nucleus of reform-minded politicians began focusing on the role technology was playing in displacing workers from their jobs. By decade's end, these early seeds planted out of concern for the unemployed would take root during an unprecedented unemployment crisis.<\/p>","DOI":"10.7591\/cornell\/9781501763991.003.0002","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,23]],"date-time":"2023-01-23T23:47:09Z","timestamp":1674517629000},"page":"16-39","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Voices for the Unemployed"],"prefix":"10.7591","author":[{"given":"Jerry","family":"Prout","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"4434","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,19]]},"container-title":["Chasing Automation"],"original-title":["Voices for the Unemployed"],"language":"en","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,23]],"date-time":"2023-01-23T23:47:10Z","timestamp":1674517630000},"score":34.765247,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/cornell-scholarship-online\/book\/45172\/chapter\/390748276"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,15]]},"ISBN":["9781501763991","9781501764011"],"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.7591\/cornell\/9781501763991.003.0002","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,15]]}}],"items-per-page":5,"query":{"start-index":0,"search-terms":null}}}
