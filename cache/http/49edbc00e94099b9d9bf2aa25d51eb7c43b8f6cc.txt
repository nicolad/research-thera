We compare 2017 to 2023 using regression-adjusted wages to make sure changes in composition of the workforce do not influence our estimates. The research period has been characterised by high labour demand, negative supply shocks, high levels of inflation and economic lockdowns, all of which have contributed to substantial labour-market dynamics. Our findings suggest that employment has been growing by 2 percent in the period 2017\u20132023, of which 1.8 percent has been due to additional workers finding employment. Women have experienced the largest increase in employment, while the employment of men on temporary contracts has slightly fallen. Wages have been rising for workers at the bottom of the wage distribution. From the median of the wage distribution onwards real gross hourly wages have been fallen. The most likely explanation for rising wages at the bottom is the stepwise increase in minimum wages enforced by new labour-market legislation.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1007\/s10645-024-09438-2","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,7,4]],"date-time":"2024-07-04T16:01:58Z","timestamp":1720108918000},"page":"233-256","update-policy":"http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1007\/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Wages and Employment in the Netherlands, 2017\u20132023"],"prefix":"10.1007","volume":"172","author":[{"given":"Iris","family":"Klinker","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Bas","family":"ter Weel","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024,7,4]]},"reference":[{"issue":"2","key":"9438_CR1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"411","DOI":"10.2307\/1912561","volume":"57","author":"JM Abowd","year":"1989","unstructured":"Abowd, J.

Here, several significant differences between ordinary commercial contracts and employment contracts will be seen, both in the scale of the use of implied terms in employment law to \u2018perfect\u2019 the bargain and in the sheer strength of some of these frequently implied terms that can, in practice, be just as important as express terms. Having looked at where these terms come from, the chapter goes on to consider the principal duties that they impose on employers and employees, some of which are old and obvious, such as the employer\u2019s duty to pay wages and the employee\u2019s duty of obedience to lawful orders. On the other hand, some are more recent and more at the cutting edge of modern employment law, such as the implied term of trust and confidence for the employee and the topical controversies over confidentiality at work in an age of electronic communication and social media. The chapter concludes by considering specifically the law on wages, including the statutory requirements of paying the national minimum wage and the national living wage.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/he\/9780192874641.003.0003","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,8,31]],"date-time":"2023-08-31T10:57:14Z","timestamp":1693479434000},"page":"135-248","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["3.
