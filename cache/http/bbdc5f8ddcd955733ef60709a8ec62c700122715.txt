Though still too early to tell for sure, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to accentuate previous fault lines in the worlds of residential real estate and introduce new ones. I pay particular attention to observations and predictions relevant to what the book has focused on\u2014such as how real estate workshop companies refigured what they do when they can no longer hold public meetings; how if at all the three HGTV programs shifted their coverage; and how the pandemic influenced where the enterprises that profited from people lived, travelled to, and worked. Among the topics are the intensification of the home as haven and workplace; the threats working and shopping at home posed to commercial real estate; how people reconfigured where they lived or decided to live elsewhere; and how the pandemic exacerbated gendered, racial, and class divisions. I discuss some of the first books, published in late 2020, to explore observations and speculations about COVID-19\u2019s consequences, especially Fareed Zakaria\u2019s <italic>Ten Lessons For A

decades punctuated by the financial crisis of the Great Recession and the public health crisis of COVID-19 have powerfully reshaped housing in America. By integrating social, economic, intellectual, and cultural histories, this illuminating work shows how powerful forces have both reflected and catalyzed shifts in the way Americans conceptualize what a house is for, in an era that has laid bare the larger structures and inequities of the economy.Daniel Horowitz casts an expansive net over a wide range of materials and sources. He shows how journalists and anthropologists have explored the impact of global economic forces on housing while filmmakers have depicted the home as a theater where danger lurks as elites gamble with the fates of the less fortunate. Real estate workshops and popular TV networks like HGTV teach home buyers how to flip\u2014or flop\u2014while online platforms like Airbnb make it possible to play house in someone else's home. And as the COVID pandemic took hold, many who had never imagined living out every moment at home found themselves cocooned there thanks to corporations like Amazon, Zoom, and Netflix.<\/p>","DOI":"10.5149\/northcarolina\/9781469671505.001.0001","type":"edited-book","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,1,22]],"date-time":"2024-01-22T15:11:44Z","timestamp":1705936304000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["American Dreams, American Nightmares"],"prefix":"10.5149","author":[{"given":"Daniel","family":"Horowitz","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"3102","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024,1,18]]},"original-title":["American Dreams, American Nightmares"],"language":"en","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2024,1,22]],"date-time":"2024-01-22T15:11:45Z","timestamp":1705936305000},"score":42.26391,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/north-carolina-scholarship-online\/book\/55655"}},"subtitle":["Culture and Crisis in Residential Real Estate from the Great Recession to the COVID-19 Pandemic"],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,22]]},"ISBN":["9781469671505","9781469671529"],"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5149\/northcarolina\/9781469671505.001.0001","relation":{"is-identical-to":[{"id-type":"doi","id":"10.1353\/book.109259","asserted-by":"subject"}]},"published":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,22]]}}],"items-per-page":5,"query":{"start-index":0,"search-terms":null}}}
