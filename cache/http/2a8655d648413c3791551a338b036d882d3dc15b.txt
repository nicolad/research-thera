They have been among the workers most affected by the COVID-19 outbreak. In India, they were the first to face the threat of dismissal from jobs during the pandemic, as they were not covered under any labour law. The onset of travel restrictions not only impacted their livelihood and income security but also their overall health. Moreover, crowded homes, substance abuse, limited access to services and no access to formal support further aggravated their vulnerabilities. The present study aimed to map the multiple vulnerabilities in terms of loss of livelihood, health consequences and domestic violence faced by domestic workers during COVID-19, their coping mechanisms, and the role of the state in providing support. This study is both qualitative and quantitative in nature comprising of 100 respondents aged 18\u201345 years, from Delhi\/National Capital Region (NCR), undertaken through purposive sampling. An interview schedule and in-depth case study method was used. The analysis is descriptive with some narratives.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1332\/policypress\/9781529224665.003.0008","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,23]],"date-time":"2023-01-23T12:04:22Z","timestamp":1674475462000},"page":"120-142","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Mapping the Multiple Vulnerabilities of Domestic Workers During COVID-19: Reflections from India"],"prefix":"10.1332","author":[{"given":"Sabiha","family":"Hussain","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"165","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,19]]},"container-title":["The Deadly Intersections of COVID-19"],"original-title":["Mapping the Multiple Vulnerabilities of Domestic Workers During COVID-19: Reflections from India"],"language":"en","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,23]],"date-time":"2023-01-23T12:04:23Z","timestamp":1674475463000},"score":29.61199,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/policy-press-scholarship-online\/book\/45199\/chapter\/390154440"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,28]]},"ISBN":["9781529224665","9781529224696"],"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1332\/policypress\/9781529224665.003.0008","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,28]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2025,2,21]],"date-time":"2025-02-21T01:23:11Z","timestamp":1740100991814,"version":"3.37.3"},"publisher-location":"London","edition-number":"1","reference-count":0,"publisher":"Routledge","isbn-type":[{"type":"electronic","value":"9781003341291"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,28]]},"DOI":"10.4324\/9781003341291-4","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,30]],"date-time":"2022-09-30T11:14:41Z","timestamp":1664536481000},"page":"37-52","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["India's domestic and foreign policy responses to COVID-19"],"prefix":"10.4324","author":[{"given":"Pradeep","family":"Taneja","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Azad Singh","family":"Bali","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"301","container-title":["COVID-19 in the Commonwealth"],"language":"en","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2023,8,30]],"date-time":"2023-08-30T09:29:38Z","timestamp":1693387778000},"score":28.919624,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.taylorfrancis.com\/books\/9781003341291\/chapters\/10.4324\/9781003341291-4"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,28]]},"ISBN":["9781003341291"],"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.4324\/9781003341291-4","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,28]]}}],"items-per-page":5,"query":{"start-index":0,"search-terms":null}}}
