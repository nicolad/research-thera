Two recent cohorts of graduates are studied and compared to two pre-COVID-19 cohorts: the 2019 cohort was unexpectedly hit by the COVID-19 crisis about six months after entering the labour market and the 2020 cohort graduated and entered the labour market in the midst of a lockdown. Our estimation results suggest short-term effects of lockdowns on employment probabilities, specifically for relatively lower educated labour-market entrants. The effects appear to be relatively small in size and seem to fade when the lockdown measures are eased. Men seem to have suffered more than women and some sectors are hit harder than others, which could result in short-run mismatches. Overall the effects appear to be less severe than during an economic recession, which is most likely due to the tight labour market and the strong measures taken by the government to mitigate the labour-market impact of the COVID-19 crisis.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1007\/s10645-022-09406-8","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,4]],"date-time":"2022-05-04T12:03:05Z","timestamp":1651665785000},"page":"279-303","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":["The Short-Term Effect of the COVID-19 Crisis on Employment Probabilities of Labour-Market Entrants in the Netherlands"],"prefix":"10.1007","volume":"170","author":[{"given":"Henri","family":"Bussink","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Tobias","family":"Vervliet","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Bas","family":"ter Weel","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,4]]},"reference":[{"key":"9406_CR1","unstructured":"Andrews, D., Deutscher, N., Hambur, J., & Hansell, D.

Most information found considered global impacts on employment and the labour market with the particular impact for the very high numbers of youth, women, migrant workers, and people with disabilities who are more likely to be employed in the informal sector. There has been a high negative impact on the informal sector and for precariously employed groups. The informal labour market is largest in low and middle-income countries and engages 2 billion workers (62 percent) of the global workforce (currently around 3.3 billion). Particularly in low- and middle-income countries, hard-hit sectors have a high proportion of workers in informal employment and workers with limited access to health services and social protection. Economic contractions are particularly challenging for micro, small, and medium enterprises to weather. Reduced working hours and staff reductions both increase worker poverty and hardship. Women, migrant workers, and youth form a major part of the workforce in the informal economy since they are more likely to work in these vulnerable, low-paying informal jobs where there are few protections, and they are not reached by government support measures. Young people have been affected in two ways as many have had their education interrupted; those in work these early years of employment (with its continued important learning on the job) have been interrupted or in some cases ended.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.19088\/k4d.2021.081","type":"report","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,24]],"date-time":"2021-05-24T15:29:11Z","timestamp":1621870151000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Covid-19 Impact on Employment and Skills for the Labour Market"],"prefix":"10.19088","author":[{"given":"Sue","family":"Enfield","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"8159","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,4]]},"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,5,24]],"date-time":"2021-05-24T15:29:11Z","timestamp":1621870151000},"score":38.54087,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/opendocs.ids.ac.uk\/opendocs\/handle\/20.500.12413\/16609"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,4]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.19088\/k4d.2021.081","published":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,4]]}}],"items-per-page":5,"query":{"start-index":0,"search-terms":null}}}
