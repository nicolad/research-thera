Two research questions and two null hypotheses guided the study.  The study adopted a quasi-experimental design specifically the pre-test, post-test control group design. The population comprised of 3,419 primary five pupils in Awka metropolis and 65 pupils selected from schools that use Macmillan English who participated in the study formed the sample for the study. Reading Achievement Test (RAT) with a reliability coefficient of 0.89 determined using Kuder-Richardson Formula 20 was used to collect data for the study. Pupils in the experimental group were taught reading using reciprocal peer tutoring, a type of cooperative learning considered in the study while those in the control group were taught reading using conventional method. Data collected were analyzed using mean scores for research questions and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) for testing the hypotheses at 0.05 level of significance. Major findings revealed that pupils taught reading with Reciprocal Peer Tutoring (RPT) performed significantly better than those taught with conventional method did. There was no significant difference in the performance of male and female pupils taught reading with RPT. Based on the findings, it was recommended that teachers training colleges and universities should incorporate reciprocal peer tutoring in their curriculum so that prospective teachers will be acquainted with the basic skills for designing RPT instructional materials for use in their respective classrooms. Teachers should be well equipped and integrated with RPT for an effective teaching, mastery and its application in the teaching and learning processes.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.24250\/jpe\/1\/2022\/caa\/ioo\/ecn\/eno","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,10]],"date-time":"2022-05-10T13:37:00Z","timestamp":1652189820000},"page":"67-78","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["EFFECT OF COOPERATIVE LEARNING ON PRIMARY SCHOOL PUPILS\u2019 READING ACHIEVEMENT IN AWKA METROPOLIS"],"prefix":"10.24250","volume":"30","author":[{"name":"Department of Early Child and Primary Education, Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Anambra State","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"CHARLES","family":"AMAECHI ANIDI","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"10350","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,1]]},"container-title":["Journal Plus Education"],"original-title":["EFFECT OF COOPERATIVE LEARNING ON PRIMARY SCHOOL PUPILS\u2019 READING ACHIEVEMENT IN AWKA METROPOLIS"],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,10]],"date-time":"2022-05-10T13:37:14Z","timestamp":1652189834000},"score":34.26301,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.uav.ro\/jour\/index.php\/jpe\/article\/view\/1712"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,1]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"1\/2022","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,1]]},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,1]]}},"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.24250\/jpe\/1\/2022\/caa\/ioo\/ecn\/eno","ISSN":["1842-077X","2068-1151"],"issn-type":[{"type":"print","value":"1842-077X"},{"type":"electronic","value":"2068-1151"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,1]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2026,1,14]],"date-time":"2026-01-14T15:25:34Z","timestamp":1768404334280,"version":"3.49.0"},"reference-count":62,"publisher":"Springer Science and Business Media LLC","issue":"2","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,27]],"date-time":"2022-09-27T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1664236800000},"content-version":"tdm","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0"},{"start":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,27]],"date-time":"2022-09-27T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1664236800000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"https:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0"}],"funder":[{"DOI":"10.13039\/501100009047","name":"Strategic Research Council","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","award":["345196"],"award-info":[{"award-number":["345196"]}],"id":[{"id":"10.13039\/501100009047","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"publisher"}]},{"DOI":"10.13039\/501100002341","name":"Academy of Finland","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","award":["213486"],"award-info":[{"award-number":["213486"]}],"id":[{"id":"10.13039\/501100002341","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"crossref"}]},{"DOI":"10.13039\/501100002341","name":"Academy of Finland","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","award":["317610"],"award-info":[{"award-number":["317610"]}],"id":[{"id":"10.13039\/501100002341","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"crossref"}]},{"DOI":"10.13039\/501100002341","name":"Academy of Finland","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","award":["335635"],"award-info":[{"award-number":["335635"]}],"id":[{"id":"10.13039\/501100002341","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"crossref"}]},{"DOI":"10.13039\/501100005222","name":"University of Jyv\u00e4skyl\u00e4","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","id":[{"id":"10.13039\/501100005222","id-type":"DOI","asserted-by":"crossref"}]}],"content-domain":{"domain":["link.springer.com"],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["Read Writ"],"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2023,2]]},"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title><jats:p>This study quantified the possible learning losses in reading and math skills among a sample of Finnish Grade 3 children (<jats:italic>n<\/jats:italic>\u2009=\u2009198) who spent 8\u00a0weeks in distance learning during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in spring 2020.

We also examined if gender, parental education, maternal homework involvement, and child\u2019s task-avoidant behavior predict children\u2019s academic skills at Grade 4 differently in the pre-COVID sample compared with the COVID sample. Children\u2019s reading and math skills were tested, mothers reported their education and homework involvement, and teachers rated children\u2019s task-avoidant behavior. The results showed, on average, lower reading skills in the COVID sample than in the pre-COVID sample but there were no differences in math skills. Although the COVID sample had lower levels in reading, their developmental trajectories in reading and math skills were not different from the pre-COVID sample before the pandemic in Grades 1 and 2. From Grade 2 to 4, however, the development was slower in reading fluency and comprehension in the COVID sample, but not in math. The predictors of change from Grade 2 to 4 in reading and math skills were not different in the samples. The results showed that the development of reading skills in particular may have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1007\/s11145-022-10358-3","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,27]],"date-time":"2022-09-27T04:02:32Z","timestamp":1664251352000},"page":"263-288","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":33,"title":["Reading and math skills development among Finnish primary school children before and after COVID-19 school closure"],"prefix":"10.1007","volume":"36","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-5709-5800","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Marja-Kristiina","family":"Lerkkanen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7190-6705","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Eija","family":"Pakarinen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-4534-6462","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jenni","family":"Salminen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-3834-9892","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Minna","family":"Torppa","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,27]]},"reference":[{"key":"10358_CR1","volume-title":"The Basic Arithmetic Test","author":"K Aunola","year":"2007","unstructured":"Aunola, K., & R\u00e4s\u00e4nen, P.
