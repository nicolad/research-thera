In particular, child care workers may have been severely affected, with 33% reporting food insecurity (RAPID-EC, 2021). Using nationally representative data from December 2020, roughly one year into the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a detailed examination of food insecurity and practices among U.S. child care workers. We found that child care workers experienced triple the rates of food insecurity compared to the general population (33.3% versus 10.2%), with 20% reporting high\/very high food insecurity. To cope with food insecurity, child care workers were more likely to use individual-level strategies (e.g., stretching food budgets) than participating in local or federal programs. After accounting for demographic characteristics, higher-income households had lower odds of experiencing food insecurity, suggesting that increasing wages for child care workers, especially during periods of economic turmoil, could prevent food insecurity among this vital workforce.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1101\/2025.02.20.25322598","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,2,21]],"date-time":"2025-02-21T16:20:14Z","timestamp":1740154814000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Food Insecurity and Food Practices among Child Care Workers During COVID-19"],"prefix":"10.64898","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4878-3791","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jaclyn M.","family":"Dynia","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2592-9241","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Abel J.","family":"Koury","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6672-8155","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Randi A.","family":"Bates","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"54368","reference":[{"key":"2025022404100651000_2025.02.20.25322598v1.1","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0000940"},{"key":"2025022404100651000_2025.02.20.25322598v1.2","unstructured":"Austin, L.

Food insecurity is both a cause and outcome of VAW, with further consequences for women\u2019s health.

Move-ment restrictions disrupted their livelihoods resulting in increased food insecurity. A mixed-method approach was used to address the research question: &amp;quot;What is the rela-tionship between food insecurity, mental health, and COVID-19 among displaced SRR working in agriculture?&amp;quot; 100 SRR participants working in agriculture were recruited from northern Syria and neighbouring countries to participate in a Household Survey. The survey data were analysed using correlation and regression analysis. Additionally, interviews with Household Survey researchers were conducted and thematically ana-lysed. Increasing food insecurity was significantly correlated with worse mental health outcomes among SRR participants (rs = -.24, p = .018). No moderation effects were found with COVID-19 measures or household responses to the pandemic. However, smaller food portions and storing food were positively correlated with poor mental health and food insecurity. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated food insecurity and mental health challenges among displaced Syrians and refugees, particularly during Ramadan 2020, highlighting the compounded effects of overlapping crises and the need for further research into resilience strategies.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.20944\/preprints202501.2110.v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,1,31]],"date-time":"2025-01-31T12:07:07Z","timestamp":1738325227000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["The Relationship Between Food Insecurity and Mental Health Among Syrians and Syrian Refugees During COVID-19"],"prefix":"10.20944","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-2505-6361","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Clara","family":"Calia","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Afnan","family":"El-Gayar","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2904-8839","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ann-Christin","family":"Zuntz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Shaher","family":"Abdullateef","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Esraa","family":"Almashhor","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Liz","family":"Grant","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Lisa","family":"Boden","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"1968","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2025,4,10]],"date-time":"2025-04-10T00:50:12Z","timestamp":1744246212000},"score":35.84001,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.preprints.org\/manuscript\/202501.2110\/v1"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2025,1,29]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.20944\/preprints202501.2110.v1","relation":{"is-preprint-of":[{"id-type":"doi","id":"10.3390\/ijerph22040549","asserted-by":"subject"}]},"published":{"date-parts":[[2025,1,29]]},"subtype":"preprint"}],"items-per-page":5,"query":{"start-index":0,"search-terms":null}}}
