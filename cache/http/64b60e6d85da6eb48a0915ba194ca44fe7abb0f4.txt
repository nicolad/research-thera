Here, utilizing data from the Office for National Statistics and the National Health Service, we examined the association between price inflation, reflected by an official index \u2018Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers\u2019 housing costs\u2019 and the number of people in contact with mental health services across different age groups. Our findings revealed that, compared with the pre-COVID-19 period (August 2016 to February 2020), significant associations emerged between specific living costs (including costs for \u2018food and non-alcoholic beverages\u2019, \u2018housing, water and fuels\u2019 and \u2018miscellaneous goods and services\u2019) and mental health service utilization during the post-COVID-19 era. This association was particularly noted for adults aged 19\u201364\u2009years and the elderly population aged 65\u2009years and over. The results highlight the importance of addressing the potential causes of mental health issues in the context of rising living costs and can inform targeted social and economic policies, such as financial subsidies for food and non-alcoholic beverages and the need to scale up mental health services.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1038\/s44220-024-00250-0","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,5,2]],"date-time":"2024-05-02T10:03:33Z","timestamp":1714644213000},"page":"712-716","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1007\/springer_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Investigating inflation, living costs and mental health service utilization in post-COVID-19 England"],"prefix":"10.1038","volume":"2","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4724-4892","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Shanquan","family":"Chen","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Miaoqing","family":"Yang","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Hannah","family":"Kuper","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"297","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024,5,2]]},"reference":[{"key":"250_CR1","unstructured":"Inflation and Price Indices (Office for National Statistics, 2023)."},{"key":"250_CR2","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","first-page":"608","DOI":"10.1192\/bjp.2019.119","volume":"215","author":"S Ibrahim","year":"2019","unstructured":"Ibrahim, S. et al.
