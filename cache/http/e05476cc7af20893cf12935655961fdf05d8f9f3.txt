Leveraging data from the 2023 Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), covering 71 education systems and spanning two decades, we quantify the global impact of pandemic-related disruptions on student achievement in mathematics and science. Using mixed-effects models, we estimate deviations from pre-pandemic trends, adjusting for demographic and school-level factors. We find that average achievement declined by 0.11 standard deviations globally, with longer school closures associated with larger losses. Disadvantaged groups\u2014including low performers, girls, and linguistic minorities\u2014experienced greater setbacks, reaching up to 0.23 standard deviations. These findings reveal a persistent global learning crisis and highlight the urgent need for targeted policy responses to address educational inequalities exacerbated by the pandemic.<\/p>","DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-6566438\/v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,6,3]],"date-time":"2025-06-03T07:21:13Z","timestamp":1748935273000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The Learning Crisis: Three Years after COVID-19"],"prefix":"10.21203","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-4939-3568","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Harry","family":"Patrinos","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Arkansas"}]},{"given":"Tomasz","family":"Gajderowicz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Warsaw"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2512-3133","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Maciej","family":"Jakubowski","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Warsaw"}]},{"given":"Alec","family":"Kennedy","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement"}]},{"given":"Christian","family":"Kjeldsen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Aarhus University"}]},{"given":"Rolf","family":"Strietholt","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement"}]}],"member":"297","link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchsquare.com\/article\/rs-6566438\/v1","content-type":"text\/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchsquare.com\/article\/rs-6566438\/v1.html","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2025,6,3]],"date-time":"2025-06-03T07:21:13Z","timestamp":1748935273000},"score":40.462566,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchsquare.com\/article\/rs-6566438\/v1"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2025,6,3]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.21203\/rs.3.rs-6566438\/v1","published":{"date-parts":[[2025,6,3]]},"subtype":"preprint"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2025,2,5]],"date-time":"2025-02-05T22:40:22Z","timestamp":1738795222986,"version":"3.37.0"},"posted":{"date-parts":[[2025]]},"group-title":"SSRN","reference-count":52,"publisher":"Elsevier BV","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"DOI":"10.2139\/ssrn.5059328","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,2,5]],"date-time":"2025-02-05T21:56:59Z","timestamp":1738792619000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The Learning Crisis: Three Years After COVID-19"],"prefix":"10.2139","author":[{"given":"Tomasz","family":"Gajderowicz","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Maciej","family":"Jakubowski","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Alec","family":"Kennedy","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Christian Christrup","family":"Kjeldsen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Harry Anthony","family":"Patrinos","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Rolf","family":"Strietholt","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"78","reference":[{"issue":"1","key":"ref1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"266","DOI":"10.1162\/rest_a_01170","article-title":"School closures during the 1918 flu pandemic","volume":"106","author":"P Ager","year":"2024","journal-title":"Review of Economics and Statistics"},{"issue":"4","key":"ref2","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"672","DOI":"10.1086\/507154","article-title":"Is the 1918 influenza pandemic over?

This descriptive study examines how museums engaged in online learning three years after COVID-19 closures. A survey was distributed through museum listservs and completed by 100 museum professionals facilitating distance learning programs in their museums. The results of this study are compared to those of studies conducted immediately before and after COVID-19 museum closures along with a study conducted one year after the closures to explore trends in the field. Survey respondents described many of the same issues related to implementing online programming that were identified in previous iterations of the survey: limited funding, staffing, time, and educational resources. Many respondents expressed interest in further training on technology use, designing culturally relevant programs, and engagement strategies. Additionally, this survey includes the respondents\u2019 self-reported levels of self-efficacy to engage in online programming. Similar to most self-efficacy studies, participants rated themselves highly in most areas. Areas where educators rated themselves less skillful included working with Pre-K students, working with groups with differing abilities, evaluating their programs, and evaluating their teaching. Many participants indicated a need for additional professional development to support their teaching online.
