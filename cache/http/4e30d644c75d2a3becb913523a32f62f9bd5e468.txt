Our analysis compares the effects of the pandemic for displaced and non-displaced citizens, controlling for individual and household characteristics and geo-localized measures of economic activity and conflict intensity. In our sample, 9.5% of respondents report that a household member has been infected by COVID-19, while 24.7% of them have suffered economic damages and 14.6% have experienced negative health effects due to the pandemic. IDPs do not display higher incidence of COVID-19 relative to comparable non-displaced individuals, but are about 60% more likely to report negative economic and health impacts caused by the pandemic. We provide suggestive evidence that the larger damages suffered by IDPs can be explained by their weaker economic status\u2014which leads to more food insecurity and indebtedness\u2014and by the discrimination they face in accessing health care.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1017\/dem.2023.13","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,25]],"date-time":"2023-10-25T08:47:41Z","timestamp":1698223661000},"page":"460-485","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Facing displacement and a global pandemic: evidence from a fragile state"],"prefix":"10.1017","volume":"90","author":[{"given":"Michele","family":"Di Maio","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Francesco","family":"Fasani","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Valerio","family":"Leone Sciabolazza","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Vasco","family":"Molini","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"56","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,25]]},"reference":[{"key":"S2054089223000135_ref39","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1177\/0022343310378914"},{"key":"S2054089223000135_ref18","unstructured":"Gentilini, U. , Almenfi, M. , Orton, I. and Dale, P.

The chapter tackles the explosive politics of the world's reserve currency.

The critical importance of tourism is that this industry is one of the two main sources of foreign exchange in the country, along with income from the Suez Canal. A\u00a0downturn in the tourism industry automatically threatens the existence of several million as jobs.\nThe author identifies 3 critical points from which a sharp drop begins. The first point is the winter of 2010-2011. The unrest of the &amp;quot;Arab Spring&amp;quot; was accompanied by the leakage of large funds from the country, social chaos, and a decrease in the general level of security, which could not but frighten potential tourists. The next key point of the fall of the tourism industry in Egypt is the death of all passengers in the crash over the Sinai Peninsula of a Russian plane flying on the Sharm el-Sheikh - St. Petersburg route, and the subsequent complete ban on flights between Russia and Egypt.\nThe third critical point was the beginning of the pandemic caused by COVID-19, officially announced by WHO on March 11, 2020, and, as a result, the almost complete closure of borders.\nBased on the analysis of statistical data from Egyptian and Western European sources, it is concluded that the indicators of the Egyptian tourism industry reflect both the trajectory of the country&amp;apos;s political state and its almost complete dependence on the global health situation.\u00a0It also concludes that the industry is extremely fragile, and the decision to partially reorient the industry towards domestic tourism, as well as receiving guests from neighboring Arab states, made in the period between the Arab Spring and the pandemic, was correct.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.31857\/s032150750016588-8","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,9,16]],"date-time":"2021-09-16T08:08:47Z","timestamp":1631779727000},"page":"29","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Egypt\u2019s tourism industry facing global challenges: from the Arab spring to the pandemic"],"prefix":"10.31857","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8021-5970","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Ekaterina A.","family":"Elkina","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Institute for African Studies, Russian Academy of Sciences"}]}],"member":"17106","container-title":["Asia and Africa Today"],"language":"en","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,15]],"date-time":"2021-10-15T10:08:08Z","timestamp":1634292488000},"score":24.590551,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/asaf-today.ru\/s032150750016588-8-1\/"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"9","published-print":{"date-parts":[[2021]]}},"alternative-id":["1"],"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31857\/s032150750016588-8","ISSN":["0321-5075"],"issn-type":[{"type":"print","value":"0321-5075"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2021]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2023,6,19]],"date-time":"2023-06-19T12:40:30Z","timestamp":1687178430534},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Princeton University Press","isbn-type":[{"value":"9780691232096","type":"electronic"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,31]]},"DOI":"10.1515\/9780691232096-016","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,8,12]],"date-time":"2022-08-12T12:23:06Z","timestamp":1660306986000},"page":"359-377","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["15.
