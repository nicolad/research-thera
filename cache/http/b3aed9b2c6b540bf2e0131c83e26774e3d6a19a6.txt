Economically they were less able to absorb the economic shock posed by COVID-19. It is also partly based on the characteristics of the pandemic. A number of countries in the sample were amongst the earliest in Europe to be hit by the pandemic and a several were harder hit in terms of both morbidity and mortality.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Design\/methodology\/approach<\/jats:title><jats:p>This study uses evidence from World Bank enterprise surveys of a sample of firms from six countries in Southern Europe. It examines the early evidence of the effects of COVID-19 on labour markets. The economic consequences potentially cover a wide range of issues. The focus of this study is on firm level evidence of the effect on labour. The evidence and the analysis are provided at a time when the pandemic is still in progress. The authors use both traditional regression analysis and IPWRA to assess the joint effect of loans versus government support on, firstly, the change in sales revenues and, secondly, the number of weeks that the firm would expect to survive with no sales revenues.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Findings<\/jats:title><jats:p>The study suggests that, despite efforts to support firms and hoard labour, there is a prospect of a significant number of firm closures with a consequent loss of employment. Temporary firm closures also represent a substantial loss of labour weeks. These are partly related to a significant number of workers subject to furloughs. The empirical findings suggest that COVID-19 cases and deaths have directly affected firm sales but government containment measures, particularly closures, have more strongly affected firms. Losses of sales were unsurprisingly related to losses of employment. Remote working has contributed to sustaining employment but online business has not affected most sectors.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Research limitations\/implications<\/jats:title><jats:p>The future progress of COVID-19 and government containment measures is uncertain, and the full economic consequences will probably continue to emerge after the end of the pandemic. The full extent of the impact on labour will probably not be the first of these. There are obvious advantages in seeking to learn lessons from the early stages of the pandemic but there are also obvious constraints. The full economic consequences will take longer to emerge than the pandemic itself and the full consequences for employment will take longer to be evident than many other economic effects.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Practical implications<\/jats:title><jats:p>Both temporary closures and furloughs impose costs that will be borne by firms, workers and government. The effects of COVID-19 on firms differ across sectors. Adverse effects tend to be higher in hospitality, non-essential retail and travel. That many firms lack the capacity to survive further temporary closures of a similar duration to those in the earlier stages emphasises that the support provided in the near future is of critical importance to control employment losses through permanent firm closures. A long-term perspective suggests neither permanent closure nor laying off workers may be the best response to a temporary crisis in demand. A stakeholder model of the firm would often suggest that it is not an optimal for the point of view of workers or the wider economy either. Both imply a preference for labour hoarding.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Social implications<\/jats:title><jats:p>The most affected are sectors with a high proportion of female workers and, in consequence, most of the countries in the sample exhibit an early decline of the already lower than average share of women in employment.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=\"abstract-subheading\">Originality\/value<\/jats:title><jats:p>The data used have been recently released and this is the first analysis using the data to look at the consequence on firms employment decisions during the Pandemic. The case of Southern Europe is much understudied, though one of the most dramatic as to the consequences of the pandemic. From a methodological point of view, the authors use not only traditional regression analysis, but also the matching approach to identify the effect of different policy options on labour demand by firms.<\/jats:p><\/jats:sec>","DOI":"10.1108\/ijm-04-2021-0222","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,10,30]],"date-time":"2021-10-30T00:39:11Z","timestamp":1635554351000},"page":"1054-1082","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":12,"title":["The labour market impact of COVID-19: early evidence for a sample of enterprises from Southern Europe"],"prefix":"10.1108","volume":"43","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-0735-3821","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Allan","family":"Webster","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-8901-0050","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Sangeeta","family":"Khorana","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8156-1453","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Francesco","family":"Pastore","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"140","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,11,2]]},"reference":[{"volume-title":"Supply Chain Contagion Waves: Thinking Ahead on Manufacturing 'Contagion and Reinfection' from the COVID Concussion","year":"2020","key":"key2022072111185050000_ref001"},{"key":"key2022072111185050000_ref002","unstructured":"Baldwin, R. and Tomiura, E.

We use a dataset collected during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, on a representative sample of citizens from Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom, interviewed on three occasions. We measure stress, anxiety and depression and labour shocks using validated scales. Our research design is a standard differences-in-differences model: we leverage the differential timing of shocks to identify the impact on mental health. In our estimations, a negative labour shock increases the measure of stress, anxiety, and depression by 16% of a standard deviation computed from the baseline.

And the outbreak of COVID-19 in late 2019 further exacerbated the situation. Emerging evidences and related studies have shown that the shock of COVID-19 has compounded vulnerabilities faced by women in employment, further marginalizing them in the labour market. In view of women employment issue under the epidemic, this paper analyzes the negative impact of COVID-19 on women employment in the labour market of China from three levels: the perspective of government, enterprises, and individuals. The study suggests that the family burden of women and unpaid work hours has increased during the pandemic. And such negative impact was amplified by factors such as the lack of relative employment security, gender discrimination and, female psychology. This will not only exerts a negative effect on female laborers but also on the society, hindering social development and economic recovery in the long run. The government should play an vital role and take effective actions to improve the situation.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.54691\/bcpbm.v34i.3089","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,15]],"date-time":"2022-12-15T04:17:43Z","timestamp":1671077863000},"page":"733-736","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The impact of the COVID-19 on women employment: evidence from labour market in China"],"prefix":"10.54691","volume":"34","author":[{"given":"Hanxiao","family":"Wang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"33225","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,12,14]]},"reference":[{"key":"37864","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1080\/13545701.2021.1876905"},{"key":"37865","doi-asserted-by":"publisher","DOI":"10.1080\/13545701.2020.1849764"},{"key":"37866","unstructured":"Emilia Barili, Veronica Grembi, Anna Rosso.
