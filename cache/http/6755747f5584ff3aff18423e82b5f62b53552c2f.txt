shifts from COVID\u201019 are expected to shutter many small businesses and entrepreneurial ventures, but there is very little early evidence on impacts. This paper provides the first analysis of impacts of the pandemic on the number of active small businesses in the United States using nationally representative data from the April 2020 Current Population Survey\u2014the first month fully capturing early effects. The number of active business owners in the United States plummeted by 3.3 million or 22% over the crucial 2\u2010month window from February to April 2020. The drop in active business owners was the largest on record, and losses to business activity were felt across nearly all industries. African\u2010American businesses were hit especially hard experiencing a 41% drop in business activity. Latinx business owner activity fell by 32%, and Asian business owner activity dropped by 26%. Simulations indicate that industry compositions partly placed these groups at a higher risk of business activity losses. Immigrant business owners experienced substantial losses in business activity of 36%. Female business owners were also disproportionately affected (25% drop in business activity). Continuing the analysis in May and June, the number of active business owners remained low\u2014down by 15% and 8%, respectively. The continued losses in May and June, and partial rebounds from April were felt across all demographic groups and most industries. These findings of early\u2010stage losses to small business activity have important implications for policy, income losses, and future economic inequality.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1111\/jems.12400","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,27]],"date-time":"2020-08-27T17:03:14Z","timestamp":1598547794000},"page":"727-740","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1002\/crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":274,"title":["The impact of COVID\u201019 on small business owners: Evidence from the first three\u2009months after widespread social\u2010distancing restrictions"],"prefix":"10.1111","volume":"29","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8634-9785","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Robert","family":"Fairlie","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Economics University of California Santa Cruz California"}]}],"member":"311","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2020,8,27]]},"reference":[{"key":"e_1_2_7_2_1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Bartik A.
