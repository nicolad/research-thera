To identify the impact, we compare labor market stocks and labor market flows over four quarters for a set of balanced panel samples of comparable workers before and after the pandemic. We find that the pandemic has negatively affected the labor market status of both men and women, but that the effect is significantly stronger for women, magnifying the already large gender gaps that characterize LAC countries. The main channel through which this stronger impact is taking place is the increase in child care work affecting women with school-age children.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.18235\/0004490","type":"report","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,10,6]],"date-time":"2022-10-06T12:32:07Z","timestamp":1665059527000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":7,"title":["The COVID-19 Pandemic in Latin American and Caribbean countries: The Labor Supply Impact by Gender"],"prefix":"10.18235","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6449-8707","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Mariana","family":"Viollaz","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mauricio","family":"Salazar-Saenz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-2339-7691","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Luca","family":"Flabbi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Monserrat","family":"Bustelo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mariano","family":"Bosch","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"7526","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2025,7,14]],"date-time":"2025-07-14T14:09:22Z","timestamp":1752502162000},"score":67.27641,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/publications.iadb.org\/en\/covid-19-pandemic-latin-american-and-caribbean-countries-labor-supply-impact-gender"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,29]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.18235\/0004490","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,9,29]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2025,3,19]],"date-time":"2025-03-19T11:25:25Z","timestamp":1742383525377},"reference-count":26,"publisher":"Elsevier BV","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["SSRN Journal"],"DOI":"10.2139\/ssrn.4114637","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,5,28]],"date-time":"2022-05-28T12:23:43Z","timestamp":1653740623000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["The COVID-19 Pandemic in Latin American and Caribbean Countries: The Labor Supply Impact by Gender"],"prefix":"10.2139","author":[{"given":"Mariana","family":"Viollaz","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mauricio","family":"Salazar-Saenz","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Luca","family":"Flabbi","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Monserrat","family":"Bustelo","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mariano","family":"Bosch","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"78","reference":[{"key":"ref1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jpubeco.2020.104245","article-title":"Inequality in the impact of the coronavirus shock: Evidence from real time surveys","volume":"189","author":"A Adams-Prassl","year":"2020","journal-title":"Journal of Public Economics"},{"issue":"3","key":"ref2","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","DOI":"10.1257\/jep.35.3.3","article-title":"E?ects of the COVID-19 Recession on the US Labor Market: Occupation, Family, and Gender","volume":"35","author":"S Albanesi","year":"2021","journal-title":"Journal of Economic Perspective"},{"key":"ref3","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","DOI":"10.3386\/w28632","author":"T Alon","year":"2021","journal-title":"From Mancession to Shecession: Women's Employment in Regular and Pandemic Recessions"},{"key":"ref4","article-title":"The Role of Work-From-Home in the Gender Asymmetries of COVID-19.

Higher mobility levels are associated with an acceleration of the risk of interruption of exports. On average, LATAM shows higher export survival levels compared to other countries. Higher innovation and market concentration favored export survival, while higher levels of Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) are associated with a lower probability of survival. Differences in survival were found between export sectors with regard to machinery and transportation equipment.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3390\/su14148709","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,18]],"date-time":"2022-07-18T01:53:22Z","timestamp":1658109202000},"page":"8709","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/mdpi_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Export Survival from Latin American Countries"],"prefix":"10.3390","volume":"14","author":[{"given":"Luis Felipe Beltr\u00e1n","family":"Morales","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Centro de Investigaciones Biol\u00f3gicas del Noroeste (CIBNOR), Instituto Politecnico Nacional 195, Colonia Playa Palo de Santa Rita, La Paz 23096, Mexico"}]}],"member":"1968","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,16]]},"reference":[{"key":"ref_1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Atkeson, A.

However, a closer look at the dynamics during the 2019-2021 period shows that (i) women were harder hit in terms of employment losses during the 2020 economic shock; (ii) despite the labor market recovery, women in 2021 often remained less likely to work than they did in 2019; nevertheless, (iii) in a subset of countries the gender gap in employment rates widened. However, relative to the value of their 2019 wages, the accumulated income losses were considerably greater for women than for men in most cases. This can create scarring effects for the future through greater vulnerability, lower incomes, and reduced probabilities of job insertion. The groups of women hit hardest by the shock were those with less than a tertiary education, those in the 14-24 year-old age group, those living in urban areas, and those working in the tertiary sector.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.18235\/0004580","type":"report","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,1,3]],"date-time":"2023-01-03T09:37:41Z","timestamp":1672738661000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["Labor Market Gender Gaps in the Time of COVID-19 in Latin America and the Caribbean"],"prefix":"10.18235","author":[{"given":"Ivonne","family":"Acevedo","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Francesca","family":"Castellani","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8675-502X","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Giulia","family":"Lotti","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-9749-3216","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Miguel","family":"Sz\u00e9kely","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"7526","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2025,7,14]],"date-time":"2025-07-14T13:56:24Z","timestamp":1752501384000},"score":39.952843,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/publications.iadb.org\/en\/labor-market-gender-gaps-time-covid-19-latin-america-and-caribbean"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,30]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.18235\/0004580","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,30]]}}],"items-per-page":5,"query":{"start-index":0,"search-terms":null}}}
