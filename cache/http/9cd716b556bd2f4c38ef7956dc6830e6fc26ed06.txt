However, according to the Center for Disease Control, about one third of the United States population is still not fully vaccinated as of June 2022.<jats:bold>Aims:<\/jats:bold> The primary aim of this work is to identify the factors associated by American citizens with the decision to be vaccinated against COVID-19. In addition, the proportion of fatal events from COVID-19 vaccinations was estimated and compared with the data in the VAERS database.<jats:bold>Methods: <\/jats:bold>A nationally representative online survey of COVID-19 health experiences was conducted. Information was collected regarding reasons for and against COVID-19 inoculations, experiences with COVID-19 illness and COVID-19 inoculations by survey respondents and their social circles. Logit regression analyses were carried out to identify factors influencing the likelihood of being vaccinated.<jats:bold>Results:<\/jats:bold> A total of 2,840 participants completed the survey between December 18 and 23, 2021. Fifty-one percent of the participants were female and the mean age was 47 (95% CI: 46.36 \u2013 47.64) years. Those who knew someone who experienced a health problem from COVID-19 were 6.5% (95% CI: 2.1 \u2013 10.9) more likely to be vaccinated, while those who knew someone who reported a health problem following vaccination were 13.3% (95% CI: 8.4 \u2013 18.2) less likely to be vaccinated. Thirty-four percent reported that they knew at least one person who had experienced a significant health problem due to the COVID-19 illness. Similarly, 22% of respondents indicated that they knew at least one person who had experienced a severe health problem following COVID-19 vaccination. With these survey data, the total number of fatalities due to COVID-19 inoculation may be as high as 278,000 (95% CI: 217,330\u2014332,608) when fatalities that may have occurred regardless of inoculation are removed.<jats:bold>Conclusions:<\/jats:bold> Knowing someone who reported serious health issues either from COVID-19 or from COVID-19 vaccination are important factors for the decision to get vaccinated. The large difference in the possible number of fatalities due to COVID-19 vaccination that emerges from this survey and the available governmental data should be further investigated.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-1847912\/v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,19]],"date-time":"2022-07-19T19:45:28Z","timestamp":1658259928000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["The role of social circle COVID-19 illness and vaccination experiences in COVID-19 vaccination decisions: a representative online survey of the United States population"],"prefix":"10.21203","author":[{"given":"Mark","family":"Skidmore","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Michigan State University"}]}],"member":"8761","link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchsquare.com\/article\/rs-1847912\/v1","content-type":"text\/html","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"text-mining"},{"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchsquare.com\/article\/rs-1847912\/v1.html","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,16]],"date-time":"2023-10-16T20:01:14Z","timestamp":1697486474000},"score":27.370136,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.researchsquare.com\/article\/rs-1847912\/v1"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,19]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.21203\/rs.3.rs-1847912\/v1","relation":{"is-preprint-of":[{"id-type":"doi","id":"10.1186\/s12879-023-07998-3","asserted-by":"subject"}]},"published":{"date-parts":[[2022,7,19]]},"subtype":"preprint"},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2025,11,20]],"date-time":"2025-11-20T23:32:38Z","timestamp":1763681558773,"version":"3.45.0"},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"MIT Press","content-domain":{"domain":[]},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,9]]},"DOI":"10.1162\/2e3983f5.3f20c35b","type":"peer-review","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,8]],"date-time":"2022-03-08T20:18:54Z","timestamp":1646770734000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Reviews: \"Prioritising COVID-19 Vaccination in Changing Social and Epidemiological Landscapes\""],"prefix":"10.1162","author":[{"given":"Jesus Gomez-","family":"Gardenes","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Zaragoza"}]}],"member":"281","review":{"type":"referee-report","language":"en"},"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,8]],"date-time":"2022-03-08T20:18:55Z","timestamp":1646770735000},"score":26.315376,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/rapidreviewscovid19.mitpress.mit.edu\/pub\/102f20vu"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,9]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1162\/2e3983f5.3f20c35b","relation":{"is-review-of":[{"id-type":"doi","id":"10.1101\/2020.09.25.20201889","asserted-by":"subject"}],"is-supplemented-by":[{"id-type":"uri","id":"https:\/\/rapidreviewscovid19.mitpress.mit.edu\/pub\/29j2ar6c","asserted-by":"subject"}]},"published":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,9]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2024,3,2]],"date-time":"2024-03-02T15:47:57Z","timestamp":1709394477119},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"MIT Press","content-domain":{"domain":[]},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,9]]},"DOI":"10.1162\/2e3983f5.4a6d11c2","type":"peer-review","created":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,9]],"date-time":"2022-03-09T01:19:31Z","timestamp":1646788771000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Review 1: \"Prioritising COVID-19 Vaccination in Changing Social and Epidemiological Landscapes\""],"prefix":"10.1162","author":[{"given":"Jesus Gomez-","family":"Gardenes","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Zaragoza"}]}],"member":"281","review":{"type":"referee-report","recommendation":"minor-revision","language":"en"},"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,9]],"date-time":"2022-03-09T01:19:31Z","timestamp":1646788771000},"score":25.903568,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/rapidreviewscovid19.mitpress.mit.edu\/pub\/29j2ar6c"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,9]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1162\/2e3983f5.4a6d11c2","relation":{"is-review-of":[{"id-type":"doi","id":"10.1101\/2020.09.25.20201889","asserted-by":"subject"}],"is-supplement-to":[{"id-type":"doi","id":"10.1162\/2e3983f5.3f20c35b","asserted-by":"subject"}]},"published":{"date-parts":[[2022,3,9]]}}],"items-per-page":5,"query":{"start-index":0,"search-terms":null}}}
