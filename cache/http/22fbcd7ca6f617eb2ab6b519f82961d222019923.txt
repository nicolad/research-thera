Women scientists with young children (under six years old within the first six years post PhD) are 5.2 percentage points less likely to achieve tenure in childcare deserts, while no significant association is observed for men with young children on average. Meanwhile, I observe no association between childcare deserts and tenure outcomes for scientists without children, regardless of gender.

Although mental health inequalities have received growing attention during the pandemic, most existing research relies on self-reported survey data with inherent limitations. To address this gap, we utilized administrative health data from a 2% stratified random sample of the total population (N = 297,368) in the National Health Insurance Database, focusing on employed individuals without a prior history of depression. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression revealed that women had higher risks of depression than men, particularly among those in their 20s to 40s, those who experienced job loss, those who had children aged 7\u20139, and those who belonged to high-income groups. These findings suggest that the intersection of employment instability and caregiving responsibilities disproportionately affected women\u2019s mental health during the pandemic. The results underscore the urgent need for gender-sensitive public health policies that expand childcare support, institutionalize flexible work arrangements such as telecommuting, and enhance access to targeted mental health services to reduce pandemic-induced gender disparities in mental health.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.3390\/covid5080134","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2025,8,15]],"date-time":"2025-08-15T08:39:07Z","timestamp":1755247147000},"page":"134","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.3390\/mdpi_crossmark_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Mental Health Impacts of COVID-19 Pandemic by Gender in South Korea: Links to Job Loss and Childcare"],"prefix":"10.3390","volume":"5","author":[{"given":"Sunju","family":"Lee","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Big Data Strategy, National Health Insurance Service, Wonju 26464, Republic of Korea"}]},{"given":"HyeSeung","family":"Wee","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"International Vaccine Institute, SNU Research Park, 1 Gwanak-ro, Gwanak-gu, Seoul 08826, Republic of Korea"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-7699-3158","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Seungho","family":"Jung","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"School of Northeast Asian Studies, Incheon National University, 119 Academy-ro, Yeonsu-gu, Incheon 22012, Republic of Korea"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0009-0009-5247-5175","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Jongmin","family":"Lee","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Economic Research Institute, The Bank of Korea, 39 Namdaemun-ro, Jung-gu, Seoul 04531, Republic of Korea"}]}],"member":"1968","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2025,8,15]]},"reference":[{"key":"ref_1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"55","DOI":"10.1016\/j.jad.2020.08.001","article-title":"Impact of COVID-19 pandemic on mental health in the general population: A systematic review","volume":"277","author":"Xiong","year":"2020","journal-title":"J.
