COVID-19 related variables employed are number of confirmed cases, number of discharged cases, total death cases and tested cases. To control for omitted variable bias, the paper considers inclusion of some economic variables such as exchange rate, inflation rate and interest rate. Using the S-estimation of the Robust Least Square, it is found that total death cases and test cases trigger more trade deficit. Increase in the number of discharged cases necessarily reduces trade deficit due to more active labour force. Depreciation of the naira triggers trade deficit due to short fall in supply and rising costs of importation. Hence, Nigeria should focus more on domestic production, increasing financing of small and medium scale enterprises alongside with adhering to COVID-19 protocol to further boost trade and economic growth.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.29216\/ueip.909898","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,29]],"date-time":"2021-04-29T00:19:36Z","timestamp":1619655576000},"page":"199-210","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["TRADE DEFICIT AND THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN 2020: EVIDENCE FROM NIGERIA \/ Trade Deficit and the Covid-19 Pandemic in 2020: Evidence From Nigeria"],"prefix":"10.29216","volume":"5","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-0602-6733","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Jimoh","family":"SAKA","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Lagos State University, Ojo, Nigeria"}]}],"member":"11758","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,4,30]]},"reference":[{"key":"ref1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Anderson, J. & van Wincoop, E.

As a result of COVID-19 restrictions, the travel and tourism sector experienced a fall and suffered financial losses. The purpose of the research was to investigate the role and importance of travel health insurance on the case study of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). The first part of the research was conducted on the basis of processing historical data from secondary sources. The second part of the research is based on the processing of data that reflect attitudes of tourists-travellers about travel health insurance before and during pandemic collected through online survey. The processing of the data from the primary and secondary sources was done through a single-variant statistical data analysis (analysis of frequency and distribution), and the correlation analysis and correlation analysis with the assessment of its statistical significance using the Chi-square test. The results confirm that during the COVID-19 pandemic in BiH, the absolute number of contracted travel insurance decreased due to the reduced number of travels, but the number of those who obligatory contracted travel health insurance increased. Of those who travelled abroad during the pandemic, 82% always or at times contracted travel health insurance. Almost half (47%) of those who contracted travel health insurance contracted an additional COVID-19 insurance. Those who travelled abroad during the pandemic, 9% had health problems caused by the COVID-19 virus infection. Main conclusion is that travel health insurance increases the willingness of tourists to travel even in case of increased risk (such the COVID-19 pandemic) and that it represents a successful model of risk sharing between tourist guests and hosts, with the mediation of insurance companies.\nArticle history: Received: April 19, 2023; Reviewed: June 15, 2023; Accepted: July 8, 2023; Available online: September 30, 2023; Available print: September 30, 2023.\nJEL classification: I13, Z32.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.24193\/subbnegotia.2023.3.01","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,10,2]],"date-time":"2023-10-02T09:42:47Z","timestamp":1696239767000},"page":"7-26","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["TRAVEL HEALTH INSURANCE AND COVID-19 PANDEMIC: EVIDENCE FROM BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA"],"prefix":"10.24193","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-6655-8432","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"\u017deljko","family":"VA\u0160KO","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0001-6923-7602","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Aleksandar","family":"OSTOJI\u0106","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-3094-5289","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Nemanja","family":"JALI\u0106","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Mileva","family":"VA\u0160KO","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"10279","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,30]]},"reference":[{"key":"ref0","unstructured":"\"1.
