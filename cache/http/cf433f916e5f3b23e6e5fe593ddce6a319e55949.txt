We take advantage of a specific policy setting, in which strict stay-at-home orders were issued and enforced in two spatially delimited areas, bringing Ghana\u2019s major metropolitan centres to a standstill, while in the rest of the country less stringent regulations were in place. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the three-week lockdown had a large and significant immediate negative impact on employment in the treated districts, particularly among workers in informal self-employment. While the gap in employment between the treated and control districts had narrowed four months after the lockdown was lifted, we detect a persistent nationwide impact on labour market outcomes, jeopardizing particularly the livelihoods of small business owners mainly operating in the informal economy.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.35188\/unu-wider\/2021\/965-5","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,4]],"date-time":"2021-02-04T08:53:27Z","timestamp":1612428807000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":26,"title":["The
