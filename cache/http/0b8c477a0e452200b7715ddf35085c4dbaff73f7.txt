Though still too early to tell for sure, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to accentuate previous fault lines in the worlds of residential real estate and introduce new ones. I pay particular attention to observations and predictions relevant to what the book has focused on\u2014such as how real estate workshop companies refigured what they do when they can no longer hold public meetings; how if at all the three HGTV programs shifted their coverage; and how the pandemic influenced where the enterprises that profited from people lived, travelled to, and worked. Among the topics are the intensification of the home as haven and workplace; the threats working and shopping at home posed to commercial real estate; how people reconfigured where they lived or decided to live elsewhere; and how the pandemic exacerbated gendered, racial, and class divisions. I discuss some of the first books, published in late 2020, to explore observations and speculations about COVID-19\u2019s consequences, especially Fareed Zakaria\u2019s <italic>Ten Lessons For A Post-Pandemic World<\/italic>.<\/p>","DOI":"10.5149\/northcarolina\/9781469671505.003.0008","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,1,22]],"date-time":"2024-01-22T15:11:24Z","timestamp":1705936284000},"page":"210-230","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Coda"],"prefix":"10.5149","author":[{"given":"Daniel","family":"Horowitz","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"3102","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024,1,18]]},"container-title":["American Dreams, American Nightmares"],"original-title":["Coda"],"language":"en","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2024,1,22]],"date-time":"2024-01-22T15:11:29Z","timestamp":1705936289000},"score":35.221924,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/academic.oup.com\/north-carolina-scholarship-online\/book\/55655\/chapter\/436098892"}},"subtitle":["From the Great Recession to The COVID-19 Pandemic"],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,22]]},"ISBN":["9781469671505","9781469671529"],"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.5149\/northcarolina\/9781469671505.003.0008","published":{"date-parts":[[2022,11,22]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,26]],"date-time":"2024-06-26T00:11:24Z","timestamp":1719360684048},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"The World Bank","isbn-type":[{"value":"9781464819018","type":"print"},{"value":"9781464819346","type":"electronic"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,10]]},"DOI":"10.1596\/978-1-4648-1901-8_ch2","type":"book-chapter","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,16]],"date-time":"2023-05-16T13:32:10Z","timestamp":1684243930000},"page":"29-60","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Poor Start: The Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Early Childhood Development and Subsequent Human Capital Accumulation"],"prefix":"10.1596","author":[{"given":"Alaka","family":"Holla","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]}],"member":"558","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,16]]},"container-title":["Collapse and Recovery: How the COVID-19 Pandemic Eroded Human Capital and What to Do about It"],"language":"en","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2024,6,25]],"date-time":"2024-06-25T21:09:35Z","timestamp":1719349775000},"score":33.308296,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/hdl.handle.net\/10986\/39403"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,10]]},"ISBN":["9781464819018","9781464819346"],"references-count":0,"alternative-id":["10.1596\/978-1-4648-1901-8_ch2","10.1596\/978-1-4648-1901-8"],"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1596\/978-1-4648-1901-8_ch2","published":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,10]]}}],"items-per-page":5,"query":{"start-index":0,"search-terms":null}}}
