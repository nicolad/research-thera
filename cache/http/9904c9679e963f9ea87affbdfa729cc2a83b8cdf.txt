The authors estimate that in 2020 extra-EU migrants were twice as likely and EU migrants were 1.6 times as likely to experience employment loss relative to comparable natives. To understand the determinants of these large gaps, the article focuses on three job characteristics\u2014 essentiality, temporariness, and teleworkability\u2014and documents that migrants were overrepresented among essential, temporary, and low-teleworkable occupations at the onset of the pandemic. The authors estimate that pre-pandemic occupational sorting accounts for 25 to 35% of the explained migrant\u2013native gap in the risk of employment termination, while sorting into industries accounts for the rest of the explained gap. More than half of this gap remains unexplained. Although major employment losses were averted thanks to the massive use of short-time work programs in Europe, migrant workers\u2014particularly extra-EU migrants\u2014suffered from high economic vulnerability during the pandemic. <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177\/00197939231173676","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,5,17]],"date-time":"2023-05-17T11:49:19Z","timestamp":1684324159000},"page":"890-918","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/sage-journals-update-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":14,"title":["Being on the Frontline?
