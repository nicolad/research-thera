Despite this trajectory, developing economies have trailed developed countries in adopting such arrangements. However, because of COVID-19 lockdowns and social distancing measures, countries such as Uruguay, where teleworking was scarce and unregulated, were forced to adopt this practice to ensure business continuity. Under such conditions, preexisting organizational and individual disparities stratified the likelihood of WFH during the pandemic. Conventional wisdom holds that the main determinants potential-to-telework stems almost exclusively from the nature of jobs themselves. This article expands the traditional understanding of telework determinants by showing that during the first stages of the pandemic, individual features of the worker, and organizational and managerial features of the employer, were both determinative of the likelihood that a given worker would work from home. We conducted a secondary data analysis of the March 2020 wave of the Work Monitor, a web-based survey of 847 employed Uruguayan adults. We fitted several multivariate regression models predicting (a) the odds of working for a company which adopted COVID-19-related teleworking policies at least for some workers and (b) the odds of WFH as a consequence of COVID-19. As the adoption of telework was largely unplanned and abrupt, results show that disparities on organizational adoption of teleworking policies were related to pre-pandemic differences across organizations in terms of preparedness, technological investment, and management practices. Results also show that employers\u2019 willingness to enable WFH policies was the strongest predictor, at any level, of the likelihood of individuals to telework during the national emergency. Individual disparities in terms of human capital also have a great impact on the likelihood of teleworking during lockdowns, but their effect depends on the existence of organizational teleworking policies. Findings\u2019 implications for the present and future of telework in developing countries are discussed. <\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1177\/00027642231155370","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,18]],"date-time":"2023-03-18T05:27:05Z","timestamp":1679117225000},"page":"1007-1031","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1177\/sage-journals-update-policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["When Lockdowns Force \u201cEveryone\u201d to Work From Home: Inequalities in Telework During COVID-19 in Uruguay"],"prefix":"10.1177","volume":"68","author":[{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-1724-9609","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Mat\u00edas","family":"Dodel","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Social Sciences, Universidad Cat\u00f3lica del Uruguay, Montevideo, Uruguay"}]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0002-8230-1370","authenticated-orcid":false,"given":"Mar\u00eda Julia","family":"Acosta","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"Department of Sociology, Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica, Montevideo, Uruguay"}]}],"member":"179","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2023,3,17]]},"reference":[{"key":"bibr1-00027642231155370","unstructured":"AGESIC.

       <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the incidence of WFH skyrocketed as business closed and distancing standards were mandated, exposing many workers to a remote work arrangement. How working from home (WFH) affects worker time management, activity timing, and enjoyment, considering gender differences and pandemic phases, is explored in the current study. The study uses real-time data from the UK Click-and-Drag Diary covering pre-pandemic, lockdown, and post-pandemic periods. Findings show no significant overall impact on time allocations, but reveal gender disparities: pre-pandemic, WFH involved less paid work and more leisure among women, but during lockdowns, patterns converged. No notable differences in instant enjoyment were found between WFH and non-WFH employees, though pre-pandemic negative correlations in women's WFH leisure time vanished during and post-pandemic. The economic implications span across labor productivity, gender dynamics in employment, business model adaptation, and work-life balance. These findings could impact corporate policies, human resource strategies, and the design of governmental policies related to the labor market and gender equality.\n<italic>JEL classification<\/italic>: J16, J22.<\/p>","DOI":"10.21203\/rs.3.rs-4240566\/v1","type":"posted-content","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,4,18]],"date-time":"2024-04-18T12:19:30Z","timestamp":1713442770000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Work from home, time allocations, and wellbeing: The impact of lockdowns"],"prefix":"10.21203","author":[{"given":"Jos\u00e9 Ignacio","family":"Gim\u00e9nez-Nadal","sequence":"first","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Zaragoza"}]},{"given":"Jorge","family":"Velilla","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[{"name":"University of Zaragoza"}]}],"member":"297","reference":[{"issue":"3","key":"ref1","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"969","DOI":"10.1162\/qjec.122.3.969","article-title":"Measuring trends in leisure: The allocation of time over five decades","volume":"122","author":"Aguiar M","year":"2007","unstructured":"Aguiar, M., & Hurst, E.
