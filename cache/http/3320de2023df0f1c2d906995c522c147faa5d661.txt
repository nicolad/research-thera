We take advantage of a specific policy setting, in which strict stay-at-home orders were issued and enforced in two spatially delimited areas, bringing Ghana\u2019s major metropolitan centres to a standstill, while in the rest of the country less stringent regulations were in place. Using a difference-in-differences design, we find that the three-week lockdown had a large and significant immediate negative impact on employment in the treated districts, particularly among workers in informal self-employment. While the gap in employment between the treated and control districts had narrowed four months after the lockdown was lifted, we detect a persistent nationwide impact on labour market outcomes, jeopardizing particularly the livelihoods of small business owners mainly operating in the informal economy.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.35188\/unu-wider\/2021\/965-5","type":"book","created":{"date-parts":[[2021,2,4]],"date-time":"2021-02-04T08:53:27Z","timestamp":1612428807000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":26,"title":["The labour market impact of COVID-19 lockdowns: Evidence from Ghana"],"prefix":"10.35188","author":[{"given":"Simone","family":"Schotte","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Michael","family":"Danquah","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Robert Darko","family":"Osei","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Kunal","family":"Sen","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"20245","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2021,2]]},"container-title":["WIDER Working Paper"],"original-title":[],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/www.wider.unu.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/Publications\/Working-paper\/PDF\/wp2021-27-COVID-19-lockdowns-labour-market-impact-Ghana.pdf","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2021,6,1]],"date-time":"2021-06-01T22:52:46Z","timestamp":1622587966000},"score":1,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.wider.unu.edu\/node\/238251"}},"subtitle":[],"short-title":[],"issued":{"date-parts":[[2021]]},"ISBN":["9789292569655"],"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.35188\/unu-wider\/2021\/965-5","relation":{},"ISSN":["1798-7237"],"issn-type":[{"type":"print","value":"1798-7237"}],"subject":[],"published":{"date-parts":[[2021]]}}}
