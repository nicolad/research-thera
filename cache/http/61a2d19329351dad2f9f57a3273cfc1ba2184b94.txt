The concept of working from home (WFH) has gained significant traction in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily because to its potential to ensure the continuity of organizations under certain circumstances. The primary objective of this study is to examine the effects of remote work arrangements implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic on the various dimensions of employee well-being in Botswana. Specifically, the case of the Botswana Unified Revenue Service (BURS) will be utilized as a focal point for analysis. The study utilized a descriptive qualitative research approach, including in-depth interviews to collect data from a sample of 18 employees of BURS who were engaged in remote work during the COVID-19 lockdown. The researchers employed a non-probability sampling technique and conducted a theme analysis to analyze the data. The findings of the research suggest that working from home (WFH) offers several advantages, including the ability to sleep for extended periods and enhanced concentration. Additionally, the flexibility and autonomy provided by working from home allow individuals to avoid distractions commonly encountered in open-office environments. However, the study also highlights certain challenges associated with WFH, such as disruptions caused by family members and feelings of isolation. The study suggests the need for further research to be conducted on the effects of remote employment in Botswana. This research would provide valuable insights for policymakers in navigating the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and its aftermath.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.20525\/ijrbs.v12i6.2504","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,14]],"date-time":"2023-09-14T08:49:48Z","timestamp":1694681388000},"page":"367-379","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":2,"title":["Examining the effects of remote work arrangements implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic on the overall wellness of employees at Botswana Unified Revenue Services (BURS)"],"prefix":"10.20525","volume":"12","author":[{"given":"Douglas","family":"Chiguvi","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"family":"Keneilwe Bakani","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]},{"family":"Thuso Sepepe","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"8429","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2023,9,14]]},"reference":[{"key":"133383","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","unstructured":"Al Qalhati, N., Karim, A.

This study analyzes data from a representative survey of Atlantic Canadian employers to evaluate three phenomena: how remote work evolved during the recent COVID\u201019 pandemic; the factors influencing these changes; and the impact of these changes on business outcomes. Our findings suggest that urban firms, technologically advanced companies in certain highly skilled industries, and firms offering greater flexibility for remote work were most likely to enhance remote work practices during the pandemic. For the average firm, an increase in the share of remote work correlated with higher organizational productivity, improved employee performance, and greater new product\/service innovation. The primary downside was heightened management complexity.

As workers increasingly want work schedules that align with personal and family obligations, companies are acknowledging the need of providing flexible work arrangements, including remote work, adaptable hours,  and  shortened  workweeks.  Research  indicates  that  flexible  work  arrangements  (FWAs)  lead  to  reduced  turnover rates, enhanced worker satisfaction, and increased organisational commitment. Flexible work schedules particularly  benefit  women,  especially  those  with  children,  by  facilitating  a  balance  between  professional  and  personal obligations, therefore enhancing employee engagement and alleviating stress. Nevertheless, issues such as poor execution and the stigma linked to flexible labour must be addressed. Ultimately, FWAs may function as a strategic asset, improving employee well-being and organisational performance.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.62674\/ijabmr.2024.v2i02.005","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,12,19]],"date-time":"2024-12-19T07:56:57Z","timestamp":1734595017000},"page":"31-38","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":3,"title":["WORK-LIFE HARMONY AND RETENTION OF EMPLOYEES: A REVIEW OF THE IMPACT OF FLEXIBLE WORK ARRANGEMENTS"],"prefix":"10.62674","volume":"02","author":[{"given":"Zhang","family":"Guoqiang","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Amiya","family":"Bhaumik","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"49296","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024]]},"container-title":["International Journal of Advances in Business and Management Research"],"link":[{"URL":"https:\/\/ejournal.svgacademy.org\/index.php\/ijabmr\/article\/view\/80\/129","content-type":"unspecified","content-version":"vor","intended-application":"similarity-checking"}],"deposited":{"date-parts":[[2024,12,19]],"date-time":"2024-12-19T07:56:59Z","timestamp":1734595019000},"score":27.658482,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/ejournal.svgacademy.org\/index.php\/ijabmr\/article\/view\/80\/129"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2024]]},"references-count":0,"journal-issue":{"issue":"02","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024]]},"published-print":{"date-parts":[[2024]]}},"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.62674\/ijabmr.2024.v2i02.005","ISSN":["2584-1718"],"issn-type":[{"value":"2584-1718","type":"electronic"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2024]]}}],"items-per-page":5,"query":{"start-index":0,"search-terms":null}}}
