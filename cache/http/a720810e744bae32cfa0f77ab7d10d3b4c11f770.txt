the UK Covid Social Survey Panel, 2020\u20132022, the European Social Survey 2002\u20132020 and the IPSOS Happiness Survey 2018\u20132023 \u2013we show individuals\u2019 reports of subjective wellbeing in Europe declined in the Great Recession of 2008\/9 and during the Covid pandemic of 2020\u20132021 on most measures. They also declined in four countries bordering Ukraine after the Russian invasion in 2022. However, the movements are not large and are not apparent everywhere. We also used data from the European Commission\u2019s Business and Consumer Surveys on people\u2019s expectations of life in general, their financial situation and the economic and employment situation in the country. All of these dropped markedly in the Great Recession and during Covid, but bounced back quickly, as did firms\u2019 expectations of the economy and the labor market. Neither the annual data from the United Nation\u2019s Human Development Index (HDI) nor data used in the World Happiness Report from the Gallup World Poll shifted much in response to negative shocks. The HDI has been rising in the last decade reflecting overall improvements in economic and social wellbeing, captured in part by real earnings growth, although it fell slightly after 2020 as life expectancy dipped. This secular improvement is mirrored in life satisfaction which has been rising in the last decade. However, so too have negative affect in Europe and despair in the United States.<\/jats:p>","DOI":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0305347","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,11,27]],"date-time":"2024-11-27T18:37:48Z","timestamp":1732732668000},"page":"e0305347","update-policy":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1371\/journal.pone.corrections_policy","source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":4,"title":["Were COVID and the Great Recession well-being reducing?"],"prefix":"10.1371","volume":"19","author":[{"given":"David G.","family":"Blanchflower","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"ORCID":"https:\/\/orcid.org\/0000-0003-1529-2010","authenticated-orcid":true,"given":"Alex","family":"Bryson","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"340","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024,11,27]]},"reference":[{"key":"pone.0305347.ref001","doi-asserted-by":"crossref","first-page":"1","DOI":"10.1093\/oep\/gpr051","article-title":"The financial crisis and the well-being of Americans","volume":"64","author":"A.
