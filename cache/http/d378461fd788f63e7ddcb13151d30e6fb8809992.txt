Researchers have undertaken empirical investigations across different countries, with a primary focus on understanding the association between lockdown measures\u2014an essential public health intervention\u2014and mental health. These studies aim to discern the causal effect of lockdowns on mental well-being. Three notable studies have adopted natural experiments to explore the causal effect of lockdowns on mental health in diverse countries. Despite variations in their research methodologies, these studies collectively support the conclusion that lockdowns have had detrimental consequences on mental health. Furthermore, they reveal that the intensity of these negative effects varies among distinct population groups. Certain segments of the population, such as women, have borne a more profound burden of the mental health costs associated with lockdown measures. In light of these findings, it becomes imperative to consider the implications for mental health when implementing public health interventions, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. While rigorous measures like lockdowns are essential for safeguarding public health, striking a balance with robust mental health support policies becomes crucial to mitigating the adverse impacts on mental well-being.<\/p>","DOI":"10.1093\/acrefore\/9780190625979.013.881","type":"reference-entry","created":{"date-parts":[[2024,1,26]],"date-time":"2024-01-26T23:25:52Z","timestamp":1706311552000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":1,"title":["COVID-19 and Mental Health: Natural Experiments of the Costs of Lockdowns"],"prefix":"10.1093","author":[{"given":"Climent","family":"Quintana-Domeque","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jingya","family":"Zeng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"286","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2024,1,30]]},"container-title":["Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Economics and Finance"],"original-title":["COVID-19 and Mental Health: Natural Experiments of the Costs of Lockdowns"],"language":"en","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2024,1,26]],"date-time":"2024-01-26T23:25:54Z","timestamp":1706311554000},"score":60.677628,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/oxfordre.com\/economics\/view\/10.1093\/acrefore\/9780190625979.001.0001\/acrefore-9780190625979-e-881"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2024,1,30]]},"ISBN":["9780190625979"],"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.1093\/acrefore\/9780190625979.013.881","published":{"date-parts":[[2024,1,30]]}},{"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,2]],"date-time":"2023-11-02T00:37:25Z","timestamp":1698885445631},"reference-count":0,"publisher":"Elsevier BV","content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"short-container-title":["SSRN Journal"],"DOI":"10.2139\/ssrn.4608788","type":"journal-article","created":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,1]],"date-time":"2023-11-01T11:22:08Z","timestamp":1698837728000},"source":"Crossref","is-referenced-by-count":0,"title":["Covid-19 and Mental Health: Natural Experiments of the Costs of Lockdowns"],"prefix":"10.2139","author":[{"given":"Climent","family":"Quintana-Domeque","sequence":"first","affiliation":[]},{"given":"Jingya","family":"Zeng","sequence":"additional","affiliation":[]}],"member":"78","published-online":{"date-parts":[[2023]]},"container-title":["SSRN Electronic Journal"],"language":"en","deposited":{"date-parts":[[2023,11,1]],"date-time":"2023-11-01T11:22:10Z","timestamp":1698837730000},"score":54.120514,"resource":{"primary":{"URL":"https:\/\/www.ssrn.com\/abstract=4608788"}},"issued":{"date-parts":[[2023]]},"references-count":0,"URL":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.2139\/ssrn.4608788","ISSN":["1556-5068"],"issn-type":[{"value":"1556-5068","type":"electronic"}],"published":{"date-parts":[[2023]]}},{"institution":[{"name":"medRxiv"}],"indexed":{"date-parts":[[2026,1,16]],"date-time":"2026-01-16T13:15:29Z","timestamp":1768569329749,"version":"3.49.0"},"posted":{"date-parts":[[2024,9,4]]},"group-title":"Health Systems and Quality Improvement","reference-count":34,"publisher":"openRxiv","license":[{"start":{"date-parts":[[2024,9,4]],"date-time":"2024-09-04T00:00:00Z","timestamp":1725408000000},"content-version":"vor","delay-in-days":0,"URL":"http:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0\/"}],"content-domain":{"domain":[],"crossmark-restriction":false},"accepted":{"date-parts":[[2024,9,4]]},"abstract":"<jats:title>Abstract<\/jats:title>\n                <jats:p>The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented global lockdowns aimed at controlling the spread of the virus.

This study examines the prevalence and incidence of mental health problems during the COVID-19 lockdowns, comparing countries that implemented strict lockdown measures with those that did not.
