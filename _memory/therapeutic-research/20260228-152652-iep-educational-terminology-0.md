## Aggregated Therapeutic Techniques

Based on the literature, for **IEP educational terminology** in students children:

| Technique | Evidence Base | Target | Key Papers | Confidence |
|-----------|---------------|--------|------------|------------|
| Self‑Directed IEP (student‑led IEP meetings) | RCT | adolescents with disabilities | [2] | high |
| COMPASS collaborative transition planning | RCT | adolescents with autism spectrum disorder | [1] | high |
| Daily report card (DRC) for IEP goal monitoring | RCT | children with ADHD | [4] | medium |
| Educational technology (adaptive literacy software) | RCT | elementary students with reading/language disabilities | [3] | medium |
| Self‑report assessment of disability/IEP status | cohort | adolescents with disabilities | [5] | low |

## Evidence Assessment
- Total papers reviewed: 5
- Meta‑analyses: 0
- RCTs: 4
- Population‑specific: 5
- Overall confidence: 70% (strong RCT support for specific IEP‑related interventions, but no meta‑analyses directly addressing IEP terminology instruction; some techniques are condition‑specific)
