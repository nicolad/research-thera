- **Population:** neurodivergent children
- **Domains:** (not specified)

## Papers Reviewed

### [1] Moving from Disorder to Difference: A Systematic Review of Recent Language Use in Autism Research (2023, 43 citations)
- **Authors:** Summer Bottini, Hannah E. Morton, Kelly A. Buchanan, Kait Gould
- **Evidence Level:** systematic_review
- **Relevance:** high
- **Population:** autistic individuals (including children and adults)
- **Key Finding:** This systematic review examines the shift from traditional medical language (TML) to alternative neuro-affirming language (ANL) in autism research, concluding that ANL can reduce stigma, increase acceptance, and align with the neurodiversity paradigm.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** Use of identity-first language (e.g., "autistic person"), avoidance of deficit‑based terms (e.g., "deficit," "disorder"), adoption of neutral or strength‑based terminology (e.g., "differences," "support needs"), co‑construction of goals with autistic individuals.
- **DOI:** (from paper ID 25de45238a2d75892c2b94915825de1e356ec988)
- **Source:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/25de45238a2d75892c2b94915825de1e356ec988

### [2] A Primer on Neurodiversity-Affirming Speech and Language Services for Autistic Individuals (2023, 13 citations)
- **Authors:** Caroline Gaddy, Hillary Crow
- **Evidence Level:** expert_opinion (tutorial)
- **Relevance:** high
- **Population:** autistic individuals (children and adults)
- **Key Finding:** This tutorial outlines the rationale for neurodiversity‑affirming care in speech‑language pathology and introduces specific clinical practices that promote culturally responsive, evidence‑based services.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** Incorporating client interests and strengths, using affirming language in reports and therapy sessions, providing psychoeducation about neurodiversity, collaborative goal‑setting, avoiding compliance‑based behavioral approaches, promoting self‑advocacy.

### [3] At a Crossroads-Reconsidering the Goals of Autism Early Behavioral Intervention From a Neurodiversity Perspective. (2022, 58 citations)
- **Authors:** G. Dawson, L. Franz, S. Brandsen
- **Evidence Level:** expert_opinion (perspective)
- **Relevance:** medium
- **Population:** autistic children (early intervention)
- **Key Finding:** The paper argues that early behavioral interventions should shift from focusing on normalization and compliance to supporting autonomy, well‑being, and a positive autistic identity, in line with neurodiversity principles.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** Goal‑setting that prioritizes child well‑being and autonomy, using language that affirms neurodivergent identity, reducing stigma through education, involving autistic voices in intervention planning.
- **DOI:** (from paper ID 2fec6100461d8c8fc0f89ee331f94a0f89703a8b)
- **Source:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2fec6100461d8c8fc0f89ee331f94a0f89703a8b

### [4] Toward Neurodiversity: How Conversation Analysis Can Contribute to a New Approach to Social Communication Assessment. (2022, 11 citations)
- **Authors:** B. Yu, L. Sterponi
- **Evidence Level:** expert_opinion (clinical focus article)
- **Relevance:** medium
- **Population:** autistic children
- **Key Finding:** Conversation analysis (CA) is presented as a neurodiversity‑affirming method for assessing social communication because it respects the natural communication styles of autistic children rather than imposing neurotypical norms.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** Conversation analysis as an assessment tool, observing and describing communication patterns without pathologizing, using descriptive rather than deficit‑based language in reports, co‑constructing communication profiles with the child.
- **DOI:** (from paper ID c7995188f42be3c87bf7772aadef07bc83bcdab6)
- **Source:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c7995188f42be3c87bf7772aadef07bc83bcdab6

### [5] Occupational Therapy Practice Guidelines for Autistic People Across the Lifespan. (2024, 7 citations)
- **Authors:** Kristie Patten, K. Murthi, Dora Onwumere, Emily C. Skaletski, Lauren M Little
- **Evidence Level:** practice_guidelines (informed by systematic reviews)
- **Relevance:** high
- **Population:** autistic people across the lifespan (including children)
- **Key Finding:** These guidelines provide evidence‑based recommendations for occupational therapy interventions that promote access, inclusion, engagement, and optimal participation, all framed within a neurodiversity‑affirming perspective.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** Strengths‑based approaches, environmental modifications, use of affirming language in documentation and communication, collaborative goal‑setting, supporting self‑determination and self‑advocacy.
- **DOI:** (from paper ID 4a7255203cedfc17235071bc2d7253100090361d)
- **Source:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4a7255203cedfc17235071bc2d7253100090361d
