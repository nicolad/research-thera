## Papers Reviewed

### [1] Collaborative practice with parents in occupational therapy for children: A scoping review. (2024, 6 citations)
- **Authors:** Carla R Lage, S. Wright, Rafaelle G de S Monteiro, Luisa Aragão, K. Boshoff
- **Evidence Level:** systematic_review (scoping review)
- **Relevance:** high
- **Population:** children, families
- **Key Finding:** Parent‑therapist collaboration is a central element of family‑centred early intervention, but the field faces challenges with inconsistent terminology and translating theory into practice. The scoping review aims to develop foundational frameworks for collaborative practice in occupational therapy.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** collaborative goal‑setting, family‑centred planning, shared decision‑making, parent coaching, needs assessment

### [2] Goal Setting and Health‑Related Outcomes in Chronic Diseases: A Systematic Review and Meta‑Analysis of the Literature From 2000 to 2020 (2022, 12 citations)
- **Authors:** Zahra Tabaei‑Aghdaei, Janet R. Mccoll‑Kennedy, L. Coote
- **Evidence Level:** meta‑analysis
- **Relevance:** medium (includes adult studies, but principles applicable to pediatric chronic conditions)
- **Population:** chronic disease patients (may include children/adolescents)
- **Key Finding:** Goal setting is associated with improved health‑related outcomes across chronic diseases; collaborative goal setting is a key component of effective interventions.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** goal setting, action planning, progress feedback, goal review, collaborative goal‑setting meetings

- **Source:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/6e518d1a1576ad3e4c314f0bd61a317f2834e8aa

### [3] Collaborative working in speech and language therapy for children with DLD‑What are parents’ needs? (2023, 13 citations)
- **Authors:** I. Klatte, M. Bloemen, Annemieke de Groot, Tina C. Mantel, M. Ketelaar
- **Evidence Level:** qualitative_descriptive
- **Relevance:** high
- **Population:** children with developmental language disorder (DLD), families
- **Key Finding:** Collaborative practice is essential to address family priorities and needs, but both speech‑language therapists and parents face challenges in implementation. The study identifies specific parent needs for effective collaboration.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** collaborative goal‑setting, partnership building, needs assessment, family‑centred communication, shared decision‑making
- **DOI:** Not provided in abstract
- **Source:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/993c1baedcc5e72486e8c23d20c4d4de0fb4db57

### [4] Self‑determination theory interventions versus usual care in people with diabetes: a protocol for a systematic review with meta‑analysis and trial sequential analysis (2020, 9 citations)
- **Authors:** A. S. Mathiesen, M. Rothmann, V. Zoffmann, J. Jakobsen, C. Gluud
- **Evidence Level:** systematic_review (protocol)
- **Relevance:** medium (focus on diabetes, but autonomy‑support principles apply to pediatric chronic care)
- **Population:** people with diabetes (includes adolescents)
- **Key Finding:** Autonomy‑supportive interventions that incorporate shared decision‑making and collaborative goal setting are hypothesized to improve patient engagement and health outcomes compared with usual care.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** autonomy support, shared decision‑making, collaborative goal setting, motivational interviewing, action planning
- **DOI:** Not provided in abstract
- **Source:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4bc9f966fb70b0f4cc2a21c817ceb97c1ed7d712

### [5] Collaboration between parents and SLTs produces optimal outcomes for children attending speech and language therapy: Gathering the evidence (2020, 58 citations)
- **Authors:** I. Klatte, Rena Lyons, K. Davies, Sam Harding, Julie Marshall
- **Evidence Level:** systematic_review
- **Relevance:** high
- **Population:** children, families
- **Key Finding:** Collaborative practice between parents and speech‑language therapists leads to optimal outcomes for children; evidence supports the integration of parent‑therapist partnership in intervention planning and delivery.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** parent training, collaborative goal‑setting, home‑practice co‑design, regular progress review, family‑centred communication
- **DOI:** Not provided in abstract

## Aggregated Therapeutic Techniques

Based on the literature, for **collaborative goal‑setting** in families children:

| Technique | Evidence Base | Target | Key Papers | Confidence |
|-----------|---------------|--------|------------|------------|
| Collaborative goal‑setting meetings | systematic_review, meta‑analysis | children, families | [1,2,5] | high |
| Shared decision‑making | systematic_review, qualitative | children, families | [1,3,4] | high |
| Family‑centred planning | systematic_review, qualitative | children, families | [1,3,5] | high |
| Action planning | meta‑analysis, systematic_review | children, families | [2,4] | medium |
| Parent coaching / training | systematic_review | children, families | [1,5] | medium |
| Goal attainment scaling & progress feedback | meta‑analysis | children, families | [2] | medium |
| Motivational interviewing | systematic_review | adolescents, families | [4] | low (limited direct evidence in children) |

## Evidence Assessment
- Total papers reviewed: 5
- Meta‑analyses: 1
- Systematic reviews: 3 (including scoping review and protocol)
- Qualitative studies: 1
- Population‑specific: 4 (directly address children/families)
- Overall confidence: 70% (moderate‑high; good evidence for collaborative practices in child‑focused therapies, but limited RCT‑level evidence specifically for collaborative goal‑setting in generic family contexts)
