## Aggregated Therapeutic Techniques

Based on the literature, for **strengths‑based terminology** in children adolescents:

| Technique | Evidence Base | Target | Key Papers | Confidence |
|-----------|---------------|--------|------------|------------|
| Strengths profiling | case_study | homeless adolescents | [3] | medium |
| Strength‑based parenting | cohort | adolescents | [5] | medium |
| Positive psychology interventions (gratitude, strengths spotting, mindfulness) | systematic_review | children adolescents | [4] | high |
| F‑words goal‑setting framework | expert_opinion | children with disabilities | [2] | medium |
| Family resilience building | systematic_review | families | [1] | high |

## Evidence Assessment
- Total papers reviewed: 5
- Meta‑analyses: 0
- RCTs: 0
- Systematic reviews: 2
- Population‑specific: 5
- Overall confidence: 65%

**Note:** The literature on explicit “strengths‑based terminology” as a stand‑alone intervention is sparse. The available evidence is embedded within broader strengths‑based approaches (positive psychology, family resilience, disability frameworks). No RCTs directly test the impact of strength‑based language alone. The strongest evidence comes from systematic reviews of positive psychology interventions and family resilience, which incorporate strength‑focused language as a core component.
