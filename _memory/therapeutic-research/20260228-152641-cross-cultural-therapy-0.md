## Papers Reviewed

### [1] Culturally tailored therapeutic interventions for people affected by dementia: a systematic review and new conceptual model. (2021, 33 citations)
- **Authors:** T. James, N. Mukadam, A. Sommerlad, Stefanny Guerra Ceballos, G. Livingston
- **Evidence Level:** systematic_review
- **Relevance:** medium
- **Population:** families affected by dementia (adults, but includes family caregivers)
- **Key Finding:** This systematic review found that culturally tailored interventions for dementia care are feasible and acceptable, but there is a lack of high-quality efficacy studies. The authors propose a new conceptual model for cultural adaptation that emphasizes context, content, and process.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** cultural tailoring, family-centered care, adaptation of intervention content and delivery, community engagement, psychoeducation
- **DOI:** not available
- **Source:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/869bca2db7a4dddfe9655b1e44397a88ef7e2e96

### [2] Cultural Adaptation and Implementation of Cognitive-Behavioral Psychosocial Interventions for Anxiety and Depression in Japanese Youth (2023, 8 citations)
- **Authors:** S. Ishikawa, K. Kishida, Takahito Takahashi, Hiroko Fujisato, Yuko Urao
- **Evidence Level:** systematic_review
- **Relevance:** high
- **Population:** Japanese youth (children and adolescents)
- **Key Finding:** The review outlines specific cultural adaptation strategies for implementing cognitive-behavioral psychosocial interventions in Japan, highlighting the importance of addressing academic pressure, family dynamics, and stigma around mental health.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** cultural adaptation of CBT, psychoeducation, cognitive restructuring, behavioral activation, mindfulness, family involvement
- **DOI:** not available

### [3] A Systematic Review of Evidence-Based Interventions for Afghan Refugee Mental Health: A Cultural Adaptation Analysis (2023, 13 citations)
- **Authors:** Zainab Hosseini, Hamza Syed, Zainab Raza, Moones Mansouri, I. Magan
- **Evidence Level:** systematic_review
- **Relevance:** high
- **Population:** Afghan refugees (including children, adolescents, and families)
- **Key Finding:** Culturally adapted evidence-based interventions for Afghan refugees show promise, but adaptations must address trauma, acculturation stress, family roles, and religious/spiritual beliefs. Community-based participatory approaches are essential.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** cultural adaptation of evidence-based interventions, trauma-informed care, narrative therapy, family systems approaches, community engagement, collaboration with traditional healers
- **DOI:** not available
- **Source:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/05b09db8359755bf1f5565bb9b18c4c0f1abda06

### [4] Cultural considerations in the treatment of mental illness among sexually abused children and adolescents: the case of Bali, Indonesia. (2015, 17 citations)
- **Authors:** C. Lesmana, L. Suryani, N. Tiliopoulos
- **Evidence Level:** case_study
- **Relevance:** medium
- **Population:** sexually abused children and adolescents in Bali
- **Key Finding:** Effective treatment in Bali requires integrating Western therapeutic models with local cultural beliefs, family structures, and traditional healing practices. Trust-building through cultural humility is critical.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** cultural formulation, integration of local beliefs and rituals, family genograms, narrative therapy, collaboration with traditional healers (balian), psychoeducation adapted to local understandings
- **DOI:** 10.1002/cad.20092
- **Source:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/52943fa67023eb2c815655eb0d6e64b885e06adb

- **Authors:** Á. Langer, Sebastián Medeiros, Nelson Valdés-Sánchez, Rodrigo Brito, C. Steinebach
- **Evidence Level:** qualitative
- **Relevance:** medium
- **Population:** adolescents in Chile
- **Key Finding:** Mindfulness-based interventions in Chilean schools were more effective when adapted to the local educational context and when adolescents' voices were incorporated into program design. Cultural relevance increased engagement and perceived benefit.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** mindfulness-based intervention, cultural adaptation of mindfulness practices, participatory design, group facilitation in educational settings, stress reduction techniques
- **DOI:** not available
- **Source:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/f2a8b8d8a4ecfa4c4496a88b7455ea8b8910088b

| Cultural adaptation of evidence-based interventions (e.g., CBT) | systematic_review | children, adolescents, families | [2,3] | high |
| Family-centered care and involvement | systematic_review, case_study | families | [1,4] | medium |
| Trauma-informed care adapted to cultural context | systematic_review | refugee families, trauma survivors | [3] | medium |
| Integration of local beliefs, rituals, and traditional healing | case_study | specific cultural groups | [4] | medium |
| Mindfulness-based interventions with cultural adaptation | qualitative | adolescents | [5] | low |
| Community engagement and participatory approaches | systematic_review | diverse communities | [1,3] | medium |

## Evidence Assessment
- Total papers reviewed: 5
- Meta-analyses: 0
- Systematic reviews: 3
- RCTs: 0
- Population-specific: 5 (all focus on specific cultural groups)
- Overall confidence: 65%

*Note: Confidence is moderate due to the lack of high-level evidence (meta-analyses, RCTs) specifically evaluating cross-cultural therapy techniques for diverse families. The available literature consists largely of systematic reviews, qualitative studies, and case studies that describe adaptation processes and conceptual models but provide limited efficacy data. API rate limiting prevented retrieval of full paper details for deeper analysis.*
