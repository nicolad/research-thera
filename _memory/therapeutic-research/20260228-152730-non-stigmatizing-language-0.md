## Context
- **Title:** Non-stigmatizing terminology for support requirements in mental health documentation
- **Population:** children youth
- **Domains:** 

## Papers Reviewed

### [1] Why is it so hard to reach agreement on terminology? The case of developmental language disorder (DLD) (2017, 238 citations)
- **Authors:** D. Bishop
- **Evidence Level:** expert_opinion (Delphi consensus)
- **Relevance:** high
- **Population:** children
- **Key Finding:** The CATALISE project used a Delphi method with 57 experts to reach consensus on non‑stigmatizing terminology for unexplained language problems in children, recommending “developmental language disorder (DLD)” over earlier labels.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** Adopt consensus‑based diagnostic terminology, use “developmental language disorder (DLD)” instead of potentially stigmatizing terms (e.g., “specific language impairment”), engage expert panels to establish agreed‑upon language.
- **DOI:** 10.1111/1460‑6984.12335
- **Source:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/275a4b3f06ef24c3da54e2ac586a5050107a2a5d

### [2] The use of person‑centered language in scientific research articles focusing on opioid use disorder. (2021, 28 citations)
- **Authors:** Brett Traxler, S. Nicks, Madison Puckett, K. Dunn, Julie M. Croff
- **Evidence Level:** cohort (observational study of published articles)
- **Relevance:** medium (principles applicable to documentation)
- **Population:** adults (language principles generalizable)
- **Key Finding:** Person‑centered language (PCL) is a recommended strategy to reduce stigma in medical research, but adherence in opioid‑use‑disorder literature remains variable.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** Use person‑centered language (e.g., “person with opioid use disorder” rather than “addict”), avoid identity‑first labels, emphasize the person before the diagnosis.

- **Source:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4e37016f0b9116835473c60a30973a860a5ba4e5

### [3] The Use of Person‑Centered Language in Scientific Research Articles Focused on Autism (2022, 15 citations)
- **Authors:** Chelsea Arnhart, Monika Neale, C. Collins, Tessa Chesher, Sara Coffey
- **Evidence Level:** cohort (observational study of published articles)
- **Relevance:** high (developmental conditions, children)
- **Population:** children/adolescents (autism)
- **Key Finding:** Despite guidelines promoting person‑centered language (PCL) to limit stigma associated with disabilities, many research articles still use stigmatizing language when referring to autism.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** Apply person‑centered language for developmental conditions (e.g., “person with autism” or “autistic person” per individual preference), avoid derogatory labels, follow organizational guidelines for non‑stigmatizing terminology.

### [4] The use of person‑centered language in scientific research articles focusing on alcohol use disorder. (2020, 10 citations)
- **Authors:** M. Hartwell, Bryce Naberhaus, Chelsea Arnhart, Ryan Ottwell, Kelly Dunn
- **Evidence Level:** cohort (observational study of published articles)
- **Relevance:** medium (principles applicable to documentation)
- **Population:** adults (language principles generalizable)
- **Key Finding:** Patient‑centered language (PCL) is underutilized in alcohol‑use‑disorder publications, indicating a need for greater adherence to non‑stigmatizing language standards.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** Avoid stigmatizing labels (e.g., “alcoholic”), use “person with alcohol use disorder,” implement editorial policies that mandate person‑centered language.
- **DOI:** Not provided
- **Source:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/93e132c5de124638f83224da86a5d1a879a7f8aa

### [5] Weight stigma and bias: standards of care in overweight and obesity—2025 (2025, 14 citations)
- **Authors:** Raveendhara R. Bannuru
- **Evidence Level:** expert_opinion (clinical guideline)
- **Relevance:** medium (includes language recommendations)
- **Population:** all ages (includes children)
- **Key Finding:** Weight stigma is linked to adverse health outcomes; standards of care recommend using non‑stigmatizing language (e.g., “person with obesity” rather than “obese person”) in clinical documentation and communication.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** Use non‑stigmatizing weight‑related terminology, avoid weight‑based labels, adopt strength‑based framing that separates the person from the condition.
- **DOI:** Not provided
- **Source:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/2321569255e116e3654174d5f6eafe05fcd17774

## Aggregated Therapeutic Techniques

Based on the literature, for **non‑stigmatizing language** in children youth:

| Technique | Evidence Base | Target | Key Papers | Confidence |
|-----------|---------------|--------|------------|------------|
| Use person‑centered language (PCL) | cohort (multiple observational studies) | children/adolescents with developmental, substance‑use, or weight‑related conditions | [2,3,4,5] | medium |
| Adopt consensus‑based diagnostic terminology | expert_opinion (Delphi consensus) | children with language disorders | [1] | high |
| Avoid stigmatizing labels and identity‑first language | cohort + expert_opinion | general mental health documentation | [2,3,4,5] | medium |
| Implement editorial/clinic policies that mandate non‑stigmatizing language | expert_opinion (guidelines) | healthcare systems, journals | [5] | low |
| Incorporate client‑preferred language and strength‑based framing | expert_opinion (implied by PCL principles) | individual clients | [1,3] | low |

## Evidence Assessment
- Total papers reviewed: 5
- Meta‑analyses: 0
- RCTs: 0
- Population‑specific: 2 (both focused on children/developmental conditions)
- Overall confidence: 40% (limited direct intervention studies; evidence consists of observational studies of language use and expert consensus, not experimental trials of language interventions)
