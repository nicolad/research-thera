### [3] Is heart rate variability biofeedback useful in children and adolescents? A systematic review. (2021, 48 citations)
- **Authors:** V. Dormal, N. Vermeulen, Sandrine Mejias
- **Evidence Level:** systematic_review
- **Relevance:** medium
- **Population:** children adolescents
- **Key Finding:** HRV biofeedback is a promising tool for improving emotional and physical health in youth, with evidence supporting its use as a therapeutic assessment and intervention for anxiety, stress, and self‑regulation difficulties.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** heart‑rate‑variability (HRV) biofeedback, psychoeducation, breathing exercises, real‑time physiological monitoring
- **DOI:** N/A
- **Source:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/86d69892b381368110fd60c6bb126b6e9a378b9a

### [4] The effects of interventions preventing self-harm and suicide in children and adolescents: an overview of systematic reviews (2019, 47 citations)
- **Authors:** Ida Sund Morken, A. Dahlgren, I. Lunde, Siri Toven
- **Evidence Level:** systematic_review
- **Relevance:** medium
- **Population:** children adolescents
- **Key Finding:** This overview of systematic reviews indicates that multi‑component interventions that include thorough assessment, safety planning, and family involvement are most effective in reducing self‑harm and suicide risk in young people.
- **Therapeutic Techniques:** comprehensive risk assessment, safety planning, family‑focused interventions, skill‑building (e.g., emotion regulation), follow‑up monitoring
- **DOI:** N/A
- **Source:** https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/87d9b56167eea8f074a344f872f3073b2bf93426

## Aggregated Therapeutic Techniques

Based on the literature, for **therapeutic assessment** in children adolescents families:

| Technique | Evidence Base | Target | Key Papers | Confidence |
|-----------|---------------|--------|------------|------------|
| Collaborative assessment interviewing | case_series | children, adolescents, families | [1,2] | medium |
| Strengths‑based & recovery‑focused assessment | case_series | adolescents | [2] | medium |
| HRV biofeedback | systematic_review | children, adolescents | [3] | high |
| Comprehensive risk & safety assessment | systematic_review | children, adolescents | [4] | high |
| Family‑involved assessment | case_series, systematic_review | families, children | [1,4] | medium |

## Evidence Assessment
- Total papers reviewed: 4
- Meta‑analyses: 0
- Systematic reviews: 2
- RCTs: 0
- Population‑specific: 4
- Overall confidence: 65%

*Note:* The available literature specifically on “therapeutic assessment” as a defined intervention for children/adolescents/families is limited. Most identified studies are qualitative or pilot‑level. The two systematic reviews provide stronger evidence for specific assessment‑linked techniques (HRV biofeedback, risk/safety assessment). Higher‑level evidence (RCTs, meta‑analyses) directly evaluating therapeutic assessment models is lacking.
