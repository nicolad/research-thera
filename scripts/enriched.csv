4,2026,Younger Firms and CEOs Allow More Work from Home,CEPR Discussion Paper 21094,https://cepr.org/publications/dp21094,,"We establish three facts about work from home (WFH) in the United States. First, employees WFH more often at younger firms – almost twice as often at firms founded after 2015 than at firms founded before 1990. Second, employees working under younger CEOs have higher levels of WFH. The average WFH rate is 1.4 days per week when the CEO is under 30, compared to 1.1 days when the CEO is 60 or older. Third, the self-employed WFH more than twice as often as wage-and-salary employees. These facts highlight the importance of organizational and managerial attributes for the prevalence of WFH.",,0.40,abstract:scrape
2,2026,The Welfare Implications of Job Retention Schemes,IMF Working Paper 2026/015,https://www.imf.org/en/publications/wp/issues/2026/01/30/the-welfare-implications-of-job-retention-schemes-573549,10.5089/9798229037884.001,"This paper examines the welfare implications of job retention schemes, where governments subsidize employers to preserve jobs during downturns. Using EU microdata from 2003 to 2018, we show that such schemes are associated with lower job separation rates, especially among lower-productivity workers. We build a search-and-matching model with occupational choice, calibrated to the United Kingdom during the global financial and sovereign debt crises. Simulations show that a retention policy scheme aimed at reducing unemployment by nearly 1 percentage point would have been both welfare-enhancing and cost-effective. Average welfare would have increased by 0.06 percent in consumption-equivalent terms, with low-income workers benefiting more than twice as much as the median worker by avoiding costly job switches and unemployment spells.",John Bluedorn; Jorge Mondragon; Ippei Shibata; Marina Mendes Tavares,1.00,"doi:scrape, abstract:scrape, authors:crossref"

This paper examines the dynamics of unemployment through a framework of labor market flows incorporating a matching function and identifies a sustained increase in labor market matching efficiency as the primary driver of persistently low post-pandemic unemployment. The framework further suggests that, barring an unlikely reversal of these efficiency gains, the unemployment rate is likely to remain below 3 percent in the medium term. Notably, despite heightened labor market tightness, post-pandemic wage growth in Korea has been modest. The paper develops a variant of the Diamond-Mortensen-Pissarides model, demonstrating that increased labor market matching efficiency helps account for this apparent paradox.",Hua Chai,1.00,"doi:scrape, abstract:scrape, authors:crossref"

Leveraging a high-frequency oil supply shock series and a rich panel of quarterly labor market data, we find that shocks raising oil prices trigger sharp and persistent employment losses, particularly in oil-importing countries, oil-intensive sectors, and among male workers. Delayed but enduring employment declines also emerge in oil-moderate sectors and among female workers, revealing broader labor market implications. In contrast, employment gains in oil-exporting countries, and following expansionary supply shocks, are comparatively modest. Labor force participation responds less consistently, with patterns displaying higher variability. These findings highlight how oil shocks transmit unevenly through labor markets, with lasting impacts across countries, sectors, and demographic groups, extending well beyond short-term macroeconomic fluctuations.",Diego Gomes; Lisa Kolovich; Hannah Yi Wei,1.00,"doi:scrape, abstract:scrape, authors:crossref"

Risks of increased emigration from further integration can be managed through promoting faster productivity growth, including through structural reforms. Model simulations show that productivity increases of 30 percent, similar to previous EU accession cases, would results in wage growth, help close the unemployment gap, and offset increased emigration through higher immigration and labor participation.

A Microsimulation Approach for European Countries,IMF Working Paper 2023/003,https://www.imf.org/-/media/files/publications/wp/2023/english/wpiea2023003-print-pdf.pdf,10.5089/9798400229985.001,"The COVID-19 pandemic had posed a dramatic impact on labor markets across Europe. Forceful fiscal responses have prevented an otherwise sharper contraction. Many countries introduced or expanded job-retention schemes to preserve jobs and support households. This paper uses a microsimulation approach (EUROMOD) and household data to assess the effectiveness of those schemes in stabilizing household income during the pandemic across European countries. Empirical evidence shows that job-retention schemes were effective in stabilizing income and, along with other measures, absorbed nearly 80 percent of market income shocks—almost doubling the extent of the automatic stabilization of the pre-pandemic tax and benefit systems. The large effects are related to the widespread use and scaling up of those schemes and a deep but short-lived disruption to labor markets during the pandemic. Along with other fiscal support measures, job-retention schemes helped mitigate the rise in the unemployment rate, by about 3 percentage points, and income inequality during the pandemic. Our results show that job-retention schemes were largely targeted, in which households more vulnerable to income losses, such as lower-income families, youth, and low-skilled workers, are able to stabilize their income.",Alexandra Solovyeva; W.

We construct a shift-share measure of the labor demand shock and instrument KA take-up using the pre-existing, state-specific share of workers eligible for KA. We find, first, that KA was crucial in mitigating unemployment: absent its expansion the unemployment rate would have increased by an additional 3 pp on average at the trough of the recession. Second, KA also bolstered domestic demand: the contraction in consumption could have been 2 to 3 times larger absent the program.
